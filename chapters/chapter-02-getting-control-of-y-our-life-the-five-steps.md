Getting Control of Y our Life: The Five Steps
of Mastering W orkflow
Don’ t let life get in your way .
THE CORE PROCESS for mastering the art of relaxed and controlled
engagement is a five-step method for managing your workflow—the ever -
present ingestion and expressions of our experiences. No matter what the
setting, there are five discrete stages that we go through as we deal with our
life, our work, and their consistent inputs and changes. Getting things under
control, whether that’ s in your kitchen or in your company , will incorporate
them. And each of these separate aspects has its own best practices and
tools, and must work together with the rest as a whole to produce that
wonderfully productive state of being present amid all the complexity . It’ s
not simply about “getting or ganized” or
“setting priorities.” Those are good things, but they happen as a result of
applying these five steps—not by themselves. These procedures I will
describe work together as a whole, and using them to produce results is both
easier and more challenging than you may think.
A useful definition of liberty is obtained only by seeking the principle of
liberty in the main  business of human life, that is to say , in the pr ocess by
which men educate their r esponses and  learn to contr ol their envir onment.
—W alter Lippmann
W e (1) captur e  what has our attention; (2) clarify  what each item means and
what to do about it; (3) or ganize  the results, which presents the options we
(4)
r eflect  on, which we then choose to (5) engage  with. This constitutes the
management of the horizontal aspect of our lives, incorporating everything
that we need to consider at any time, as we move forward moment to
moment.
These are not arbitrary or purely theoretical suggestions—they are what we
all do, anytime we want to bring something under control and stabilize it for
productive action. If you’re planning to cook dinner for friends, but you
come home and find the kitchen a total mess, how do you get on top of it?
First you identify all the stuf f that doesn’ t belong where it is, the way it is
(capture); you then determine what to keep and what to throw away (clarify);
you put things where they need to go—back in the refrigerator , in the
garbage, or in the sink (or ganize); you then check your recipe book, along
with the ingredients and utensils you have (reflect); and you get started by
putting butter in the pan to start melting (engage).
The method is straightforward enough in principle, and it is generally how
we all go about our work in any case, but in my experience most people can
significantly improve their handling of each one of the five steps. The
quality of our workflow management is only as good as the weakest link in
this five-phase chain, so all the links must be integrated and supported with
consistent standards.
Most people have had major inef ficiencies in their versions of this control
process in the lar ger contexts of life and work, but the stresses of our new
world are blowing out the weak spots. The ubiquity of information access
and rapidity of change happening, as you read this, consistently increase the
complexity of your life and work. Only having to deal with a messy kitchen
would be a relief!
Small leaks, with added pressure, become big ones. One missed e-mail,
untracked commitment, or decision avoided can have hugely magnified
consequences. Because the volume of pertinent content is not diminishing or
the input slowing down, avoiding getting a grip on the martial art of
workflow mastery will be at your own peril.
Most people have major weaknesses in their (1) captur e  process. Most of
their commitments to do something are still in their head. The number of
coulds, shoulds, might-want-tos, and ought-tos they generate in their minds
are way out beyond what they have recorded anywhere else.
Many have collected lots of things but haven’ t (2) clarified  exactly what
they represent or decided what action, if any , to take about them. Random
lists strewn everywhere, meeting notes, vague to-dos on Post-its on their
refrigerator or computer screens or in their T asks function in a digital tool—
all lie not acted on
and numbing to the psyche in their ef fect. Those lists alone often create more
stress than they relieve.
Others make good decisions about stuf f in the moment but lose the value of
that thinking because they don’ t ef ficiently (3) or ganize  the results. They
determined they should talk to their boss about something, but a reminder of
that lies only in the dark recesses of their mind, unavailable in the
appropriate context, in a trusted format, when they could use it.
Still others have good systems but don’ t (4) r eflect on the contents
consistently enough to keep them functional. They may have lists, plans, and
various checklists available to them (created by capturing, clarifying, and
or ganizing), but they don’ t keep them current or access them to their
advantage.
Many people don’ t look ahead at their own calendars consistently enough to
stay current about upcoming events and deadlines, and they consequently
become victims of last-minute craziness.
Ask yourself, “When do I need to see what, in what form, to get it of f my
mind?” Y ou build a system for function, not just to have a system.
Finally , if any one of these previous links is weak, what someone is likely to
choose to (5) engage  in at any point in time may not be the best option. Most
decisions for action and focus are driven by the latest and loudest inputs, and
are based on hope instead of trust. People have a constant nagging sense that
they’re not working on what they should be, that they “don’ t have time” for
potentially critical activities, and that they’re missing out on the timeless
sense of meaningful doing that is the essence of stress-free productivity .
The dynamics of these five steps need to be understood, and good techniques
and tools implemented to facilitate their functioning at an optimal level. I
have found it very helpful, if not essential, to separate these stages as I move
through my day . There are times when I want only to collect input and not
decide what to do with it yet. At other times I may just want to process my
notes from a meeting. Or I may have just returned from a big trip and need
to distribute and or ganize what I collected and processed on the road. Then
there are times when I want to review the whole inventory of my work, or
some portion of it. And obviously a lot of my time is spent merely doing
something that I need to get done.
I have discovered that one of the major reasons many people haven’ t had a
lot of success with getting or ganized is simply that they have tried to do all
five steps at one time. Most, when they sit down to make a list, are trying to
collect the “most important things” in some order that reflects priorities and
sequences, without setting out many (or any) real actions to take. But if you
don’ t decide what needs to be done about your assistant’ s birthday , because
it’ s “not that important” right now , that open loop will take up ener gy and
prevent you from having a totally ef fective, clear focus on what’ s important.
This chapter explains the five steps in detail. Chapters 4 through 8 provide a
step-by-step program for implementing an airtight system for each phase,
with lots of examples and best practices.
Capture
It’ s important to know what needs to be captured and how to do that most
ef fectively so you can process it appropriately . In order for your mind to let
go of the lower -level task of trying to hang on to everything, you have to
know that you have truly captured everything that might represent something
you have to do or at least decide about, and that at some point in the near
future you will process and review all of it.
Gathering 100 Per cent of the “Incompletes”
In order to eliminate “holes in your bucket,” you need to collect and gather
placeholders for , or representations of, all the things you consider
incomplete in your world—that is, anything personal or professional, big or
little, of ur gent or minor importance, that you think ought to be dif ferent than
it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to
changing.
Many of the things you have to do are being collected for  you as you read
this. Mail is coming into your various mailboxes—physical and virtual.
Y ou’re likely still getting packages and letters at home. Physical stuf f is still
landing in your in-tray at work, along with e-mail, texts, and voice mails into
your digital tools. But at the same time, you’ve been capturing things in your
environment and in your head that don’ t belong where they are, the way they
are, for all eternity . Even though it may not be as obviously “in your face” as
your e-mail, the stuf f still requires some kind of resolution—a loop to be
closed, something to
be done. Strategy ideas loitering in a notebook, “dead” gadgets in your desk
drawers that need to be fixed or thrown away , and out-of-date magazines on
your cof fee table all fall into this category of stuf f.
A task left undone r emains undone in two places—at the actual location of
the task, and inside  your head. Incomplete tasks in your head consume the
ener gy of your attention as they gnaw at  your conscience.
—Brahma Kumaris
As soon as you attach a “should,” “need to,” or “ought to” to an item, it
becomes an incomplete. Decisions you still need to make about whether or
not you are going to do something, for example, are already incompletes.
This includes all of your I’m-going-tos, in which you’ve decided to do
something but haven’ t started moving on it yet. And it certainly includes all
pending and in-progress items, as well as those things on which you’ve done
everything you’re ever going to do except acknowledge that you’re finished
with them.
In order to manage this inventory of open loops appropriately , you need to
capture it into “containers” that hold items in abeyance until you have a few
moments to decide what they are and what, if anything, you’re going to do
about them. Then you must empty these containers regularly to ensure that
they remain viable capture tools.
Basically , everything potentially meaningful to you is already being
collected, in the lar ger sense. If it’ s not being directly managed in a trusted
external system of yours, then it’ s resident somewhere in your mental space.
The fact that you haven’ t put an item in your in-tray doesn’ t mean you
haven’ t got it.
But we’re talking here about making sure everything you need is collected
somewhere other than in your head.
The Captur e T ools
There are several types of tools, both low- and high-tech, that can be used to
collect your incompletes. The following can all serve as versions of an in-
tray , capturing self-generated input as well as information from external
sources: Physical in-tray
Paper -based note-taking devices
Digital/audio note-taking devices
E-mail and text messaging
The Physical In-T ray
The standard plastic, wood, leather , or wire tray has for years been the most
common tool for collecting paper -based and physical materials that need
some sort of processing: mail, magazines, meeting notes, corporate reports,
tickets, receipts, flash drives, business cards—even flashlights with dead
batteries!
W riting Paper and Pads
Loose-leaf and bound notebooks, note cards, and paper pads of all shapes
and sizes work fine for collecting random ideas, input, things to do, and so
on.
Whatever fits your taste and logistical needs.
Digital and V oice Note T aking
Computers, tablets, smartphones, and all kinds of new mobile tech gadgetry
emer ging daily can be used for capturing notes for later processing,
preserving an interim record of things you need to remember to deal with.
E-mail and T exting
If you’re wired to the rest of the world through e-mail and texting, your
software contains some sort of holding area for incoming messages and files,
where they can be stored until they are viewed, read, and processed.
T echnology Integration
The evolution of the digital world has made it increasingly possible to
integrate these various channels automatically . W ritten notes from paper and
whiteboards can be instantly recorded, recognized, and funneled into
software storage. V oice messages can be recorded, digitized, and printed out.
Y ou can text an idea to your e-mail from your mobile device.
Whether high-tech or low-tech, all of the tools and functions I’ve described
serve similarly as in-trays, capturing potentially meaningful information,
commitments, ideas, and agreements for action.
The Success Factors for Capturing
Unfortunately , merely having an in-tray doesn’ t make it functional. Most
people do have collection devices of some sort, but usually they’re more or
less out of control or seriously underutilized. Let’ s examine the three
requirements to make the capturing phase work:
Get It All Out of Y our Head
Get a pur ge for your brain. It will do better than for your stomach.
—Michel Eyquem de Montaigne
If you’re still trying to keep track of too many things in your mental space,
you likely won’ t be motivated to use and empty your in-trays with integrity .
Most people are relatively careless about these tools because they know they
don’ t represent discrete, whole systems anyway; there’ s an incomplete set of
things in their in-tray and an incomplete set in their mind, and they’re not
getting a real payof f from either one, so their thinking goes. It’ s like trying to
play pinball on a machine that has big holes in the table, so the balls keep
falling out: there’ s little motivation to keep playing the game.
Keep everything in your head or out of your head. If it’ s in between, you
won’ t trust either one.
These collection tools should become part of your lifestyle. Keep them close
by so no matter where you are you can collect a potentially valuable thought
—
think of them as being as indispensable as your toothbrush or your driver ’ s
license or your glasses. The sense of trust that nothing possibly useful will
get lost will give you the freedom to have many more good ideas.
Minimize the Number of Captur e Locations
Y ou should have as many in-trays as you need and as few as you can get by
with. Y ou need this function to be available to you in every context, since
things you’ll want to capture may show up almost anywhere. If you have too
many collection zones, however , you won’ t be able to process them easily or
consistently .
Funnel all potentially meaningful inputs through minimal channels, directed
to you for easily accessed review and assessment about their nature.
An excess of collection buckets can easily happen in both the low-tech and
hi-tech arenas. There is a real improvement opportunity for most people on
the low-tech side, primarily in the areas of note taking and physical in-tray
collection. W ritten notes need to be corralled and processed instead of left
lying embedded in stacks, notebooks, and drawers. Paper and physical
materials need to be funneled into physical in-trays instead of being
scattered over myriad piles in all the available corners of the world. On the
high-tech side, potential sources of input for stuf f to be assessed and
processed have proliferated tremendously , with the advent of social media,
multiple connected devices, and the ubiquity of e-mail. People now often
have more than one e-mail account, are participating in at least one if not
several social media worlds, and operate with numerous digital devices.
Paradoxically , the tendency to accumulate a huge backlog of random inputs
to deal with, and the number of people troubled with that, have increased
dramatically , as the digital revolution has “streamlined” our lives.
Implementing standard tools and procedures for capturing ideas and input
will become more and more critical as your life and work become more
sophisticated. As you proceed in your career , for instance, you’ll probably
notice that your best ideas about work will not come to you at  work. The
ability to leverage that thinking with good collection devices that are always
at hand is key to staying on top of your world.
Empty the Captur e T ools Regularly
The final success factor for capturing should be obvious: if you don’ t empty
and process the stuf f you’ve collected, your tools aren’ t serving any function
other
than the storage of amorphous material. Emptying the contents does not
mean that you have to finish what’ s there; it just means that you have to
decide more specifically what it is and what should be done with it, and if
it’ s still unfinished, or ganize it into your system. Y ou must get it out of the
container . Y ou don’ t leave it or put it back into “in”! Not emptying your in-
tray is like having garbage cans and mailboxes that no one ever dumps or
deals with—you just have to keep buying new ones to hold an eternally
accumulating volume.
Blockage in the flow of anything undermines the ability to be present, fresh,
and creative in that arena.
In order to get “in” to empty , however , an integrated life-management
system must be in place. T oo much stuf f is left piled in in-trays (physical and
digital) because of a lack of ef fective systems “downstream” from there. It
often seems easier to leave things in “in” when you know you have to do
something about them but can’ t do it right then. The in-tray , especially for
paper and e-mail, is the best that many people can do in terms of
or ganization—at least they know that somewher e  in there is a reminder of
something they still have to do.
Unfortunately , that safety net is lost when the piles get out of control or the
inventory of e-mails gets too extensive to be viewed on one screen.
When you master the next two steps and know how to process and or ganize
your inputs and incompletes easily and rapidly , “in” can return to its original
function. Let’ s move on to how to get those in-trays and e-mail systems
empty without necessarily having to do the work now .
Clarify
T eaching them the item-by-item thinking required to get their collection
containers empty is perhaps the most critical improvement I have made for
virtually all the people I’ve worked with. When the head of a major
department in a global corporation had finished processing all her open
items with me, she sat back in awe and told me that though she had been
able to relax about what meetings to go to thanks to her trust in her calendar ,
she had never felt that same relief about all the many other aspects of her
job, which we had just clarified together . The actions and information she
needed to be reminded of were now
identified and entrusted to a concrete system.
It is better to be wr ong than to be vague.
—Fr eeman Dyson
What do you need to ask yourself (and answer) about each e-mail, text,
voice mail, memo, page of meeting notes, or self-generated idea that comes
your way?
This is the component of input management that forms the basis for your
personal or ganization. Many people try to get or ganized but make the
mistake of doing it with incomplete batches of stuf f. Y ou can’ t or ganize
what’ s incoming—
you can only capture it and process it. Instead, you or ganize the actions
you’ll need to take based on the decisions you’ve made about what needs to
be done.
The whole deal—both the capturing  and or ganizing  phases—is represented
in the center “trunk” of the decision-tree model shown here.
What Is It?
This is not a dumb question. W e’ve talked about stuf f. And we’ve talked
about collection buckets. But we haven’ t discussed what stuf f is and what to
do about it. For example, many of the items that tend to leak out of our
personal or ganizing systems are amorphous forms that we receive from the
government or from our company—do we actually need to do something
about them? And what about that e-mail from human resources, letting us
know that blah-blah about the blah-blah is now the policy of blah-blah? I’ve
unearthed piles of messages in stacks and desk drawers that were tossed
there because the client didn’ t take just a few seconds to figure out what, in
fact, the communication or document was really about. Which is why the
next decision is critical.

WORKFLOW DIAGRAM—PROCESSING
Is It Actionable?
There are two possible answers for this: yes  and no .
No Action Requir ed If the answer is no , there are three possibilities: These
three categories can themselves be managed; we’ll get into that in a later
chapter . For now , suf fice it to say that you need a wastebasket and <Del>
key for trash, a “tickler” file or calendar for material that’ s incubating, and a
good filing system for reference information.
Actionable This is the yes  group of items, stuf f about which something needs
to be done. T ypical examples range from an e-mail requesting a summary of
the speech you’ve agreed to give at a luncheon to the notes in your in-tray
from your face-to-face meeting with the group vice president about a
significant new project that involves hiring an outside consultant.
T wo things need to be determined about each actionable item:
It does not take much str ength to do things, but it r equir es a gr eat deal of
str ength to decide  what to do.
—Elbert Hubbar d
If It’ s About a Pr oject . . . Y ou need to capture that outcome on a “Projects”
list.
That will be the stake in the ground that will keep reminding you that you
have an open loop until it is finished. A W eekly Review of the list (see page
50 ) will bring this item back to you as something that’ s still outstanding. It
will stay fresh and alive in your management system (versus your head) until
it is completed or eliminated.
What’ s the Next Action? This is the critical question for anything you’ve
captured; if you answer it appropriately , you’ll have the key substantive
thing to or ganize. The “next action” is the next physical, visible activity that
needs to be engaged in, in order to move the current reality of this thing
toward completion.
Some examples of next actions might be:
Call Fred re: name and number of the repair shop he mentioned.
Draft thoughts for the budget-meeting agenda.
T alk to Angela about the filing system we need to set up.
Research Internet for local watercolor classes.
These are all real physical activities that need to happen. Reminders of these
will become the primary grist for the mill of your personal productivity-
management system.
Do It, Delegate It, or Defer It Once you’ve decided on the next action, you
have three options:
1. Do it. If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done  at the
moment it is defined.
2. Delegate it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, ask yourself,
Am I the right person to do this? If the answer is no, delegate  it to the
appropriate entity .
3. Defer it, If the action will take longer than two minutes, and you are the
right person to do it, you will have to defer  acting on it until later and track it
on one or more “Next Actions” lists.
Or ganize
Being or ganized means simply that where something is matches what it
means to you.
The outer ring of the workflow diagram shows the eight discrete categories
of reminders and materials that will result from your processing all your
stuf f.
T ogether they make up a total system for or ganizing just about everything
that’ s on your plate, or could be added to it, on a daily and weekly basis.
For nonactionable items, the possible categories are trash , incubation , and
r efer ence . If no action is needed on something, you toss it, “tickle” it for
later reassessment, or file it so you can find the material if you need to refer
to it at another time. T o manage actionable things, you will need a list of
pr ojects , storage or files for pr oject plans and materials , a calendar , a list of
r eminders of  next actions , and a list of r eminders of things you’r e waiting
for .
All of the or ganizational categories need to be physically contained in some
form. When I refer to “lists,” I just mean some sort of reviewable set of
reminders, which could be lists on notebook paper or in some computer
program or even file folders holding separate pieces of paper for each item.
For instance, the list of current projects could be kept on a page in a loose-
leaf planner; it could be held in a category within the T asks function of a
software application; or it could be in a simple physical file folder labeled
“Projects List.” Incubating reminders (such as “After 01 March contact my
accountant to set up a meeting”) may be stored in a paper -based “tickler” or
“bring-forward” file or in a digital calendar application.

WORKFLOW DIAGRAM—ORGANIZING
Pr ojects
I define a project as any desired result that can be accomplished within a
year that requires more than one action step. This means that some rather
small things you might not normally call projects are going to be on your
Projects list, as well as some big ones. The reasoning behind my definition is
that if one step won’ t complete something, some kind of goalpost needs to
be set up to remind you that there’ s something still left to do. If you don’ t
have a placeholder to remind you about it, it will slip back into your head.
The reason for the one-year time frame is that anything you are committed to
finish within that scope needs to be reviewed weekly to feel comfortable
about its status. Another way to think of this is as a list of open loops, no
matter what the size.
A Partial Pr ojects List

Projects do not initially need to be listed in any particular order , by size, or
by priority . They just need to be on a master list so you can review them
regularly enough to ensure that appropriate next actions have been defined
for each of them.
Y ou don’ t actually do  a project; you can only do action steps r elated  to it.
When enough of the right action steps have been taken, some situation will
have been created that matches your initial picture of the outcome closely
enough that
you can call it “done.” The list of projects is the compilation of finish lines
we put before us to keep our next actions moving on all tracks appropriately .
There may be reasons to sort your projects into dif ferent subcategories,
based upon dif ferent areas of your focus, but initially creating a single list of
all of them will make it easier to customize your system appropriately as you
get more comfortable with its usage.
Pr oject Support Material
For many of your projects, you will accumulate relevant information that
you will want to or ganize by theme or topic or project name. Y our Projects
list will be merely an index. All of the details, plans, and supporting
information that you may need as you work on your various projects should
be contained in separate file folders, computer files, notebooks, or binders.
Support Materials and Refer ence Files Once you have or ganized your
project support material by theme or topic, you will probably find that it is
almost identical to your reference material and could be kept in the same
reference file system (a W edding file could be kept in the general-reference
files, for instance).
The only dif ference is that in the case of active projects, support material
may need to be reviewed on a more consistent basis to ensure that all the
necessary action steps are identified.
I usually recommend that people store their support materials out of sight. If
you have a good working reference file system close enough at hand, you
may find that that’ s the simplest way to or ganize them. There will be times,
though, when it’ll be more convenient to have the materials out and instantly
in view and available, especially if you’re working on a hot project that you
need to check references for several times during the day . File folders in wire
standing holders or in stackable trays within easy reach can be practical for
this kind of pending paperwork.
The digital world has paradoxically made or ganizing reference and support
materials simultaneously simpler and more complex. It’ s quick and easy to
capture something from somewhere and copy it somewhere else, but
deciding where it goes can be daunting, given the plethora of parking places
available to us and the myriad ways that we might want the information
available to others as well as ourselves. The best practice is to keep your
digital reference world as simple as possible, and consistently reviewed and
pur ged.
The Next-Action Categories
As the workflow diagram makes clear , the next-action decision is central.
That action needs to be the next physical, visible behavior , without
exception, on every open loop.
Any less-than-two-minute actions that you perform, and all other actions that
have already been completed, do not, of course, need to be tracked; they’re
done.
What does  need to be tracked is every action that has to happen at a specific
time or on a specific day (enter those on your calendar); those that need to be
done as soon as they can (add these to your Next Actions lists); and all those
that you are waiting for others to do (put these on a W aiting For list).
Calendar
Reminders of actions you need to take fall into two categories: those about
things that have to happen on a specific day or time, and those about things
that just need to get done as soon as possible. Y our calendar handles the first
type of reminder .
Three things go on your calendar:
time-specific actions;
day-specific actions; and
day-specific information
T ime-Specific Actions This is a fancy name for appointments. Often the next
action to be taken on a project is attending a meeting that has been set up to
discuss it. Simply tracking that on the calendar is suf ficient.
Day-Specific Actions These are things that you need to do sometime on a
certain day , but not necessarily at a specific time. Perhaps you told Mioko
you would call her on Friday to check that the report you’re sending her is
OK. She won’ t have the report until Thursday , and she’ s leaving the country
on Saturday , so Friday is the time window for taking the action—but
anytime Friday will be fine.
That should be tracked on the calendar for Friday but not tied to any
particular time slot—it should just go on the day . It’ s useful to have a
calendar on which you can note both time-specific and day-specific actions.
Day-Specific Information The calendar is also the place to keep track of
things you want to know about on specific days—not necessarily actions
you’ll have to take but rather information that may be useful on a certain
date. This might include directions for appointments, activities that other
people (family or staf f) will be involved in then, or events of interest. It’ s
helpful to put short-term tickler information here, too, such as a reminder to
call someone after he or she returns from vacation. This is also where you
would want to park important reminders about when something might be
due, or when something needs to be started (in case it hasn’ t been yet), given
a determined lead time.
Blessed ar e the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape.
—Michael McGriffy , M.D.
No Mor e “Daily T o-Do” Lists on the Calendar Those three things are what
go on the calendar , and nothing else! This might be heresy to past-century
time-management training, which almost universally taught that the daily to-
do list is key . But such lists embedded on a calendar don’ t work, for two
reasons.
First, constant new input and shifting tactical priorities reconfigure daily
work so consistently that it’ s virtually impossible to nail down to-do items
ahead of time. Having a working game plan as a reference point is always
useful, but it must be able to be renegotiated at any moment. T rying to keep
a list on the calendar , which must then be reentered on another day if items
don’ t get done, is demoralizing and a waste of time. The Next Actions lists I
advocate will hold all of those action reminders, even the most time-
sensitive ones. And they won’ t have to be rewritten daily .
Second, if there’ s something on a daily to-do list that doesn’ t absolutely have
to get done that day , it will dilute the emphasis on the things that truly do. If
I have  to call Mioko on Friday because that’ s the only day I can reach her ,
but then I add five other , less important or less time-sensitive calls to my to-
do list, when the day gets crazy I may never call Mioko. My brain will have
to take back the reminder that that’ s the one phone call I won’ t get another
chance at. That’ s not utilizing the system appropriately . The way I look at it,
the calendar should be sacred territory . If you write something there, it must
get done that day or not at all. The only rewriting should be for changed
appointments.
That said, there’ s absolutely nothing wrong with creating a quick, informal,
short list of “if I have time, I’d really like to . . .” kinds of things, picked
from your Next Actions inventory . It just should not be confused with your
“have-tos,” and it should be treated lightly enough to discard or change
quickly as the inevitable surprises of the day unfold.
The “Next Actions” List(s)
So where do your entire action reminders go? On Next Actions lists, which,
along with the calendar , are at the heart of daily action-management
or ganization and orientation.
Any longer -than-two-minute, non-delegatable action you have identified
needs to be tracked somewhere. “Call Jim Smith re: budget meeting,” “E-
mail family update to friends,” and “Draft ideas re: the annual sales
conference” are all the kinds of action reminders that need to be kept in
appropriate lists, to be assessed as options for what we will do at any point in
time.
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler .
—Albert Einstein
If you have only twenty or thirty of these, it may be fine to keep them all on
one list labeled “Next Actions,” which you’ll review whenever you have any
free time. For most of us, however , the number is more likely to be fifty to
150.
In that case it makes sense to subdivide your Next Actions list into
categories, such as Calls to make when you have a window of time and your
phone, or Computer action items to see as options when you’re at that
device.
Nonactionable Items
Y ou need well-or ganized, discrete systems to handle things that require no
action as well as those that do. No-action systems fall into three categories:
trash, incubation, and reference.
T rash
T rash should be self-evident. Throw away , shred, or recycle anything that
has no potential future action or reference value. If you leave this stuf f
mixed in with other categories, it will seriously undermine the system and
your clarity in the environment.
Incubation
There are two other groups of things besides trash that require no immediate
action but that you will want to keep. Here, again, it’ s critical that you
separate nonactionable from actionable items; otherwise you will tend to go
numb to your piles, stacks, and lists and not know where to start or what
needs to be done.
Say you read something in a newsletter that gives you an idea for a project
you might want to do someday , but not now . Y ou’ll want to be reminded of it
again later so you can reassess the option of doing something about it in the
future. Or you get a notice about the upcoming season of your local
symphony , and you see that the program that really interests you is still four
months away—
too distant for you to move on it yet (you’re not sure what your travel
schedule will be that far out). But if you are in town, you’d like to go. What
should you do about that?
There are two kinds of incubation tools that could work for this kind of
thing: Someday/Maybe lists and a tickler system.
Someday/Maybe It can be useful and inspiring to maintain an ongoing list of
things you might want to do at some point but not now . This is the “parking
lot”
for projects that would be impossible to move on at present but that you
don’ t want to for get about entirely . Y ou’d like to be reminded of the
possibility at regular intervals.
T ypical Partial Someday/Maybe List
Get a sailboat
Learn Spanish
T ake a watercolor class
Renovate the kitchen
Build a lap pool
T ake a balloon ride
Build a wine cellar
Spend a month in T uscany
Create my own W eb page
Set up a foundation for kids
Get a piano
Publish my memoir
Get scuba certification
Learn to tango
Learn to throw pottery
Give a neighborhood party
Build a koi pond
These items are of the nature of “projects I might want to do, but not now . .
.
but I’d like to be reminded of them regularly .” Y ou must review this list
periodically if you’re going to get the most value from it. I suggest you
include a scan of the contents in your W eekly Review (see page 50 ).
Y ou’ll probably have some other types of information that are similar to
Someday/Maybe but that probably need a review only when you have an
ur ge to engage in a particular kind of activity . These would be lists such as:
Books to read
W ines to taste
Recipes to try
Movies to rent
W eekend trips to take
Things my kids might like to do
Seminars to take
W eb sites to surf
These kinds of reminders can greatly expand your options for creative
exploration. Having an or ganizational tool that allows you to easily make
lists such as these, ad hoc, is quite worthwhile.
T ickler System A second type of things to incubate are those you don’ t want
or need to be reminded of until some designated time in the future. A most
elegant version of holding for review of this nature is the tickler file,
sometimes also referred to as a “suspense,” “follow-on,” or “perpetual” file.
This is a system that allows you to almost literally mail something to
yourself, for receipt on some designated date in the future.
Y our calendar can serve the same function. Y ou might remind yourself on
your calendar for March 15, for example, that your taxes are due in a month;
or for September 12, that Swan Lake  will be presented by the Bolshoi at the
Civic Auditorium in six weeks.
For further details, refer to chapter 7.
Refer ence Material
Many things that come your way require no action but have intrinsic value
as information. Y ou will want to keep and be able to retrieve these as
needed. They can be stored in paper -based or digital form.
Paper -based material—anything from the menu for a local takeout deli to the
plans, drawings, and vendor information for a landscape project—is best
stored in ef ficient physical or digital retrieval systems. These can range from
pages in a loose-leaf planner or notebook, for a list of favorite restaurants or
the phone numbers of members of a school committee, to whole file cabinets
dedicated to the due-diligence paperwork for a corporate mer ger . Though
more and more information is showing up in digital form, print versions are
at times still an ef fective way for it to be stored and reviewed.
Electronic storage can include everything from cloud-based data storage to
archive folders in your communications software.
The most important thing to remember here is that reference should be
exactly that—information that can be easily  referred to when required.
Reference systems generally take two forms: (1) topic- and area-specific
storage, and (2) general-reference files. The first types usually define
themselves in terms of how they are stored—for example, a file drawer
dedicated to contracts, by date; a drawer containing only confidential
employee-compensation information; a series of cabinets for closed legal
cases that might need to be consulted for future trials; or a customer relations
management (CRM) database for client and prospect histories.
General Refer ence Filing The second type of reference system is one that
everyone needs close at hand for storing ad hoc information that doesn’ t
belong in some predesigned lar ger category . Y ou need somewhere to keep
the instruction manuals for your kitchenware, the handwritten notes from
your meeting about the Smith project, and those yen you didn’ t get to
exchange at the end of your most recent trip to T okyo (and that you can use
when you go back there).
The lack of a good general-reference file can be one of the biggest
bottlenecks in implementing an ef ficient personal management system. If
filing and storing isn’ t easy and fast (and even fun!), you’ll tend to stack,
pile, or digitally accumulate things instead of putting them away
appropriately . If your reference material doesn’ t have nice clean edges to it,
the line between
actionable and nonactionable items will blur , visually and psychologically ,
and your mind will go numb to the whole business. Establishing a good
working system for this category of material is critical to ensuring stress-free
productivity; we will explore it in detail in chapter 7.
Reflect
It’ s one thing to write down that you need milk; it’ s another to be at the store
and remember it. Likewise, writing down that you need to call a friend to
find out how he’ s doing after a significant event in his life and wish him well
is dif ferent from remembering it when you’re at a phone and have some
discretionary time.
Y ou need to be able to step back and review the whole picture of your life
and work from a broader perspective as well as drop down “into the weeds”
of concrete actions to take, as needed, and at appropriate intervals. For most
people the magic of workflow management is realized in the consistent use
of the reflection step. This is where, in one important case, you take a look at
all your outstanding projects and open loops, at what I call Horizon 1 level
(see page 55) , on a weekly basis. It’ s your chance to scan all the defined
actions and options before you, thus radically increasing the ef ficacy of the
choices you make about what you’re doing at any point in time.
Y our life is more complex than any single system can describe or coordinate,
but the GTD methodology creates a coherent model for placeholding key
elements, which still require attention, being kept current, and being
reviewed in a coordinated way . Most people have some simple components
of this in various places, but the contents and the utilization of these are
elementary , at best.
What to Review When
If you set up a personal or ganization system structured as I recommend, with
a Projects list, a calendar , Next Actions lists, and a W aiting For list, not
much will be required to maintain that system.
The item you’ll probably review most frequently is your calendar , which
will remind you about the “hard landscape” for the day—that is, what things
truly have  to be handled that day . This doesn’ t mean that the contents there
are the most “important” in some grand sense—only that they must get done.
At any
point in time, knowing what has to get done and when creates a terrain for
maneuvering. It’ s a good habit, as soon as you conclude an action on your
calendar (a meeting, a phone call, the final draft of a report that’ s due), to
check and see what else remains to be done.
Review whatever lists, overviews, and orientation maps you need to, as often
as you need to, to get their contents of f your mind.
After checking your calendar , you’ll most often turn to your Next Action
lists. These hold the inventory of predefined actions that you can take if you
have any discretionary time during the day . If you’ve or ganized them by
context (At Home; At Computer; In Meeting with Geor ge) they’ll come into
play only when those contexts are available.
Projects, W aiting For , and Someday/Maybe lists need to be reviewed only as
often as you think they have to be in order to stop you from wondering about
them.
Critical Success Factor: The W eekly Review
The affairs of life embrace a multitude of inter est, and he who r easons in any
one of them,  without consulting the r est, is a visionary unsuited to contr ol
the business of the world.
—James Fenimor e Cooper
Everything that might require action must be reviewed on a frequent enough
basis to keep your mind from taking back the job of remembering and
reminding. In order to trust the rapid and intuitive judgment calls that you
make about actions from moment to moment, you must consistently retrench
at some more elevated level. In my experience (with thousands of people),
that translates into a behavior critical for success: the W eekly Review .
All of your Projects, active project plans, and Next Actions, Agendas,
W aiting For , and even Someday/Maybe lists should be reviewed once a
week.
This also gives you an opportunity to ensure that your brain is clear and that
all the loose strands of the past few days have been captured, clarified, and
or ganized.
If you’re like most people, you’ve found that things can get relatively out of
control during the course of a few days of operational intensity . That’ s to be
expected, but it will continue to increase in tandem with the ubiquity of your
always-on, connected world. Y ou wouldn’ t want to distract yourself from too
much of the work at hand in an ef fort to stay totally “squeaky clean” all the
time.
But in order to af ford the luxury of “getting on a roll” with confidence,
you’ll probably need to clean house and refresh the contents once a week.
The W eekly Review is the time to:
Gather and process all your stuf f.
Review your system.
Update your lists.
Get clean, clear , current, and complete.
Y ou have to use your mind to get things of f your mind.
Most people don’ t have a really complete system, and they get no real payof f
from reviewing things for just that reason: their overview isn’ t total. They
still have a vague sense that something may be missing. That’ s why the
rewards to be gained from implementing this whole process are exponential:
the more complete the system is, the more you’ll trust it. And the more you
trust it, the more complete you’ll be motivated to keep it. The W eekly
Review is a master key to maintaining that standard.
Most people feel best about their work the week before they go on vacation,
but it’ s not because of the vacation itself. What do you do the last week
before you leave on a big trip? Y ou clean up, close up, clarify , or ganize, and
renegotiate all your agreements with yourself and others. Y ou do this so you
can relax and be present on the beach, on the golf course, or on the slopes,
with nothing else on your mind. I suggest you do this weekly instead of
yearly , so you can bring this kind of “being present” to your everyday life.
Engage
The basic purpose of this workflow-management process is to facilitate good
choices about what you’re doing at any point in time. At 10:33 a.m. Monday ,
deciding whether to call Sandy , finish the proposal, or clean up your e-mails
will always be an intuitive call, but with the proper orientation you can feel
much more confident about your choices. Y ou can move from hope to trust
in your actions, immediately increasing your ener gy and ef fectiveness.
Every decision to act is an intuitive one. The challenge is to migrate from
hoping  it’ s the right choice to trusting it’ s the right choice.
Thr ee Models for Making Action Choices
Let’ s assume for a moment that you’re not resisting any of your stuf f out of
insecurity or procrastination. There will always be a long list of actions that
you are not doing at any given moment. So how will you decide what to do
and what not to do, and feel good about both?
The answer is, by trusting your intuition. If you have captur ed , clarified ,
or ganized , and r eflected  on all your current commitments, you can galvanize
your intuitive judgment with some intelligent and practical thinking about
your work and values.
There are three models that will be helpful for you to incorporate in your
decision making about what to do. They won’ t tell you answers—whether
you call Mario, e-mail your son at school, or just have an informal
conversation with your secretary—but they will assist you in framing your
options more intelligently . And that’ s something that the simple time- and
priority-management panaceas can’ t do.
1. The Four -Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment  At 3:22
on W ednesday , how do you choose what to do? At that moment there are
four criteria you can apply , in this order: context, time available, ener gy
available, and priority .
The first three describe the constraints within which you continually operate,
and the fourth provides the hierarchical values to ascribe to your actions.
Context Y ou are always constrained by what you have the capability to do at
this time. A few actions can be done anywhere (such as drafting ideas about
a project with pen and paper), but most require a specific location (at home,
at your of fice) or having some productivity tool at hand, such as a phone or a
computer .
These are the first factors that limit your choices about what you can do in
the moment.
There is always more to do than you can do, and you can do only one thing
at a time. The key is to feel as good about what you’re not  doing as about
what you ar e  doing at that moment.
T ime A vailable When do you have to do something else? Having a meeting
in five minutes would prevent doing any actions that require more time.
Ener gy A vailable How much ener gy do you have? Some actions you have to
do require a reservoir of fresh, creative mental ener gy . Others need more
physical horsepower . Some need very little of either .
Priority Given your context, time, and ener gy available, what action
remaining of your options will give you the highest payof f? Y ou’re in your
of fice with a phone and a computer , you have an hour , and your ener gy is 7.3
on a scale of 10.
Should you call the client back, work on the proposal, process your e-mails,
or check in with your spouse to see how his or her day is going?
This is where you need to access your intuition and begin to rely on your
judgment call in the moment. T o explore that concept further , let’ s examine
two more models for deciding what’ s most important for you to be doing.
2. The Thr eefold Model for Identifying Daily W ork
When you’re getting things done, or “working” in the universal sense, there
are three dif ferent kinds of activities you can be engaged in:
Doing predefined work
Doing work as it shows up
Defining your work
Doing Pr edefined W ork When you’re doing predefined work, you’re
working
from your Next Actions lists and calendar—completing tasks that you have
previously determined need to be done, or managing your workflow . Y ou’re
making the calls you need to make, drafting ideas you want to brainstorm,
attending meetings, or preparing a list of things to talk to your attorney
about.
Doing W ork as It Shows Up Often things come up ad hoc—unsuspected,
unforeseen—that you either have to or choose to engage in as they occur .
For example, your partner walks into your of fice and wants to have a
conversation about the new product launch, so you talk to her instead of
doing all the other things you could be doing. Every day brings surprises—
unplanned-for things that just show up—and you’ll need to expend at least
some time and ener gy on many of them. When you follow these leads,
you’re deciding by default that these things are more important than
anything else you have to do at those times.
Defining Y our W ork Defining your work entails clearing up your in-tray ,
your digital messages, and your meeting notes, and breaking down new
projects into actionable steps. As you process your inputs, you’ll no doubt be
taking care of some less-than-two-minute actions and tossing and filing
numerous things (another version of doing work as it shows up). A good
portion of this activity will consist of identifying things that need to get done
sometime, but not right away . Y ou’ll be adding to all of your lists as you go
along.
Once you have defined all your work, you can trust that your lists of things
to do are complete. And your context, time, and ener gy available still allow
you the option of more than one thing to do. The final thing to consider is
the nature of your work, and its goals and standards.
3. The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Y our Own W ork
Priorities should drive your choices, but most models for determining them
are not reliable tools for much of our real work activity . In order to know
what your priorities are, you have to know what your work is. And there are
at least six dif ferent perspectives from which to define that. T o use an
appropriate analogy , the conversation has a lot do with the horizon, or
distance of perception.
Looking out from a building, you will notice dif ferent things from dif ferent
floors.
Horizon 5: Purpose and principles
Horizon 4: V ision
Horizon 3: Goals
Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountabilities
Horizon 1: Current projects
Ground: Current actions
Let’ s start from the bottom up:
Gr ound: Curr ent Actions This is the accumulated list of all the actions you
need to take—all the phone calls you have to make, the e-mails you have to
respond to, the errands you’ve got to run, and the agendas you want to
communicate to your boss and your life partner . Y ou’d probably have more
than a hundred of these items to handle if you stopped the world right now
with no more input from yourself or anyone else.
Horizon 1: Curr ent Pr ojects Generating most of the actions that you
currently have in front of you are the thirty to one hundred projects on your
plate. These are the relatively short-term outcomes you want to achieve,
such as setting up a new home computer , or ganizing a sales conference,
moving to a new headquarters, and getting a dentist.
Complete the pr ojects you begin, fulfill the commitments you have made, live
up to your  pr omises—then both your subconscious and conscious selves can
have success, which leads to a  feeling of fulfillment, worthiness and oneness.
—John-Roger
Horizon 2: Ar eas of Focus and Accountabilities Y ou create or accept your
projects and actions because of the roles, interests, and accountabilities you
have. These are the key areas of your life and work within which you want
to achieve results and maintain standards. Y our job may entail at least
implicit commitments for things like strategic planning, administrative
support, staf f development, market research, customer service, or asset
management. And your personal life has an equal number of such focus
arenas: health, family , finances, home environment, spirituality , recreation,
etc. These are not things to finish but rather to use as criteria for assessing
our experiences and our engagements, to maintain balance and sustainability ,
as we operate in our work and our world.
Listing and reviewing these responsibilities gives a more comprehensive
framework for evaluating your inventory of projects.
Horizon 3: Goals What you want to be experiencing in various areas of your
life and work one to two years from now will add another dimension to
defining your work. Often meeting the goals and objectives of your job will
require a shift in emphasis of your job focus, with new accountabilities
emer ging. At this horizon personally , too, there probably are things you’d
like to accomplish or have in place, which could add importance to certain
aspects of your life and diminish others.
Horizon 4: V ision Projecting three to five years into the future generates
thinking about bigger categories: or ganization strategies, environmental
trends, career and lifestyle transition circumstances. Internal factors include
longer -term career , family , financial, and quality-of-life aspirations and
considerations. Outer -world issues could involve changes af fecting your job
and or ganization, such as technology , globalization, market trends, and
competition. Decisions at this altitude could easily change what your work
might look like on many levels.
Horizon 5: Purpose and Principles This is the big-picture view . Why does
your company exist? Why do you  exist? What really matters to you, no
matter what?
The primary purpose for anything provides the core definition of what the
work really is. It is the ultimate job description. All goals, visions,
objectives, projects, and actions derive from this, and lead toward it.
These horizon analogies are somewhat arbitrary , and in real life the
important conversations you will have about your focus and your priorities
may not exactly fit one level or another . They can provide a useful
framework, however , to remind you of the multilayered nature of your
commitments and tasks.
Minute-to-minute and day-to-day you don’ t have time to think. Y ou need to
have already thought.
Obviously many factors must be considered before you feel comfortable that
you have made the best decision about what to do and when. “Setting
priorities”
in the traditional sense of focusing on your long-term goals and values,
though obviously a necessary core focus, does not provide a practical
framework for a
vast majority of the decisions and tasks you must engage in day to day .
Mastering the flow of your work at all the levels you experience that work
provides a much more holistic way to get things done and feel good about it.
Part 2 of this book will provide specific coaching about how to use these
models for making action choices, and how the best practices for capturing,
clarifying, planning, or ganizing, and reflecting all contribute to your greatest
success with them.
