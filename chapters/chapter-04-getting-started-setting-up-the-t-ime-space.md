Getting Started: Setting Up the T ime, Space,
and T ools
IN P AR T 2 we’ll move from a conceptual framework and limited
application of workflow mastery to full-scale implementation and best
practices. Going through this program often gives people a level of relaxed
control they may never have experienced before, but it usually requires the
catalyst of step-by-step procedures to get there. T o that end, I’ll provide a
logical sequence of things to do, to make it as easy as possible for you to
get on board and glean the most value from these techniques.
Much of the detail in this section can easily seem more than you can digest
or implement on a first read. It’ s included to provide a blow-by-blow
instruction manual for you if you’ve decided to do a full-scale
implementation of the model, which could take at least two full,
uninterrupted days to implement. It is information and suggestions you will
very likely want to revisit at some point, to glean a new level of application,
as you get started down the GTD path.
Implementation—Whether All-Out or Casual—Is a Lot
About “T ricks”
If you’re not sure you’re committed to an all-out implementation of these
methods, let me assure you that much of the value people get from this
material is good tricks. Sometimes just one good trick can make it
worthwhile to range through this information: I’ve had people tell me, for
example, that the best thing they got from our seminars was simply the two-
minute rule. T ricks are for the not-so-smart, not-so-conscious part of us. T o
a great degree, the highest-performing people I know are those who have
installed the best tricks in their lives. I know that’ s true of me. The smart
part of us sets up things for us to do
that the not-so-smart part responds to almost automatically , creating
behavior that produces high-performance results. W e trick ourselves into
doing what we ought to be doing.
It is easier to act yourself into a better way of feeling than to feel yourself
into a better way of  action.
—O. H. Mowr er
For instance, if you’re a semi-regular exerciser like I am, you probably have
your own little tricks to get yourself to exercise. My best trick is costume —
the clothing I put on or take of f. If I put on exercise gear , I’ll start to feel
like exercising; if I don’ t I’m very likely to feel like doing something else.
Let’ s look at an example of a real productivity trick. Y ou’ve probably taken
work home that you had to bring back the next day , right? It was mission-
critical that you not for get it the next morning. So where did you put it the
night before?
Did you put it in front of the door , or on your keys, so you’d be sure to take
it with you? For this you get an education? What a sophisticated piece of
self-management technology you’ve installed in your life! But actually
that’ s just what it is. The smart part of you the night before knows that the
not-so-smart part of you first thing in the morning may barely be conscious.
“What’ s this in front of the door? Oh, that’ s right, I’ve got to take this with
me!”
What a class act. But really , it is. It’ s a trick I call Put It in Front of the
Door .
For our purposes the “door” is going to be the door of your mind, not your
house. But it’ s the same idea.
If you were to take out your calendar right now and look closely at every
single item for the next fourteen days, you’d probably come up with at least
one
“Oh, that reminds me, I need to _______.” If you then captured that value-
added thought into some place that would trigger you to act, you’d feel
better already , have a clearer head, and get more positive things done. It’ s
not rocket science, just a good trick.
If you take out a clean sheet of paper right now , along with your favorite
writing instrument, and for three minutes focus solely on the most awesome
project on your mind, I guarantee you’ll have at least one “Oh, yeah, I need
to consider ______.” Then capture what shows up in your head on the piece
of paper and put it where you might actually use the idea or information.
Y ou won’ t be one ounce smarter than you were ten minutes ago, but you’ll
have
added value to your work and life.
The big secret to ef ficient creative and productive thinking and action is to
put the right things in your focus at the right time.
Much of learning how to manage workflow in a masterful way is about
laying out the gear and practicing the moves so that the requisite thinking
happens more automatically and it’ s a lot easier to get engaged in the game.
The suggestions that follow about getting time, space, and tools in place are
all trusted methods for making things happen at a terrific new level.
If you’re sincere about making a major leap forward in your personal
management systems, I recommend that you pay close attention to the
details and follow through on the suggestions provided next in their
entirety . The whole will be greater than the sum of the parts. Y ou’ll also
discover that the execution of this program will produce real progress on
real things that are going on in your life right now . W e’ll get lots done that
you want to get done, in new and ef ficient ways that may amaze you.
Setting Aside the T ime
Don’ t be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated. Y ou can’ t cr oss a
chasm in two small  jumps.
—David L. Geor ge
I recommend that you create a block of time to initialize this process and
prepare a workstation with the appropriate space, furniture, and tools. If
your space is properly set up and streamlined, it can reduce your
unconscious resistance to dealing with your stuf f and even make it
attractive for you to sit down and crank through your input and your work.
An ideal time frame for most people is two whole days, back to back.
(Don’ t be put of f by that if you don’ t have that long to spend, though: doing
any of the activities I suggest will be useful, no matter how much or how
little time you devote to them. T wo days are not required to benefit from
these techniques and principles—they will start to pay of f almost instantly .)
Implementing the full capturing process can take up to six hours or more,
and clarifying and deciding on actions for all the input you’ll want to
externalize and capture in your system can easily take another eight hours.
Of course, you can also collect and process your stuf f in chunks, but it’ll be
much easier if you can tackle that front-end portion in one fell swoop.
The ideal time for me to work with someone in implementing this
methodology is on a weekend or holiday , because the chance of outside
disturbance is minimal then. If I work with someone on a typical workday ,
we first make sure that no meetings are scheduled and only emer gency
interruptions are allowed; phone calls are routed to voice mail or logged by
assistants for review and handling during a break. I don’ t recommend using
after -hours for this work. It usually means seriously reduced horsepower
and a big tendency to get caught up in “rabbit trails. ”*
Dedicate two days to this process, and it will be worth many times that in
terms of your productivity and mental health.
For many of the executives I work with, holding the world back for two
contiguous days is the hardest part of the whole process—the perceived
necessity to be constantly available for meetings and communications when
they’re at work is dif ficult for them to let go of. That’ s why we often resort
to weekends. If you work in an open cubicle or of fice, it will be even more
of a challenge to isolate suf ficient time blocks on a regular workday during
of fice hours.
It’ s not that the procedure itself is so sacred; it’ s just that it takes a lot of
mental ener gy to capture and make decisions about such a lar ge inventory
of open loops, especially when they’ve been open, undecided, or stuck for
way too long. Interruptions can double the time it takes to get through
everything. If you can get to ground zero in one contained time period, it
gives you a huge sense of control and accomplishment and frees up a
reservoir of ener gy and creativity .
Later on you can maintain your system in shorter spurts “between the lines”
of your regular day .
Setting Up the Space
Y ou’ll need to choose a physical location to serve as your central cockpit of
control. If you already have a desk and of fice space set up where you work,
that’ s probably the best place to start. If you work from a home of fice,
obviously that will be your prime location. If you already have both, you’ll
want to establish identical, even interchangeable systems in both places,
though one will probably be primary . If you feel that you don’ t have either
—you really don’ t have any central physical spot you would call home for
dealing with your stuf f
—it’ s imperative that you create one. Even if you have a mobile, high-tech
life that is primarily virtual, you’ll still require a private setting as a base
camp from which to operate. Y ou will want to implement this program
wherever you might actually do work and process input, but starting with a
primary location is optimal.
The basics for a workspace are just a writing surface and room for an in-
tray , and probably (for most people) space for core digital tools as well.
Some, such as a foreman in a machine shop, an intake nurse on a hospital
floor , or your children’ s nanny , won’ t need much more than that. Most
homemakers won’ t necessarily need a lar ge area to manage their workflow ,
but having enough of a discrete space dedicated to the processing of notes,
mail, home and family projects and activities, finances, and the like is
critical. Usually this business-of-life stuf f is scattered helter -skelter in the
kitchen, in the hallway , on the dining table, on book and media shelves, etc.,
with a numbing ef fect.
The writing surface will of course expand for most professionals, to include
a phone (and char ger), a computer , stacking trays, working file drawers,
reference shelves. Some may feel the need for a printer , whiteboards, and/or
multimedia conferencing equipment. The seriously self-contained will also
want gear for exercise, leisure, and hobbies.
Y ou must have a dedicated, individual, self-contained workspace—at home,
at work, and even in transit.
A functional workspace is critical. If you don’ t already have a dedicated
workspace and in-tray , get them now . That goes for students, homemakers,
and retirees, too. Everyone must have a physical locus of control from
which to deal with everything else.
If I had to set up an emer gency workstation in just a few minutes, I would
buy an unfinished door , place it on top of two two-drawer filing cabinets
(one at
each end), place three stack trays on it, and add a paper , pad, and pen. That
would be my home base. (If I had time to sit down, I’d also buy a stool!)
Believe it or not, I’ve been in several executive of fices that wouldn’ t be as
functional.
If Y ou Go to an Office, Y ou’ll Still Need a Space at Home
Don’ t skimp on workspace at home. As you’ll discover through this
process, it’ s critical that you have at least a satellite home system identical
to the one in your of fice. Many people I’ve worked with have been
somewhat embarrassed by the degree of chaos that reigns in their homes, in
contrast to their of fices at work; they’ve gotten tremendous value from
giving themselves permission to establish the same setup in both places. If
you’re like many of them, you’ll find that a weekend spent setting up a
home workstation can make a revolutionary change in your ability to
or ganize your life.
An Office Space in T ransit
If you move around much, as a business traveler or just as a person with a
mobile lifestyle, you’ll also want to set up an ef ficiently or ganized micro-
of fice-in-transit. More than likely this will consist of a briefcase, pack, or
satchel with appropriate folders and portable workstation supplies.
Many people lose opportunities to be productive because they’re not
equipped to take advantage of the odd moments and windows of time that
open up as they move from one place to another , or when they’re in of f-site
environments. The combination of a good processing style, the right tools,
and good interconnected systems at home and at work can make traveling a
highly leveraged way to get certain kinds of work done. As technology
continues to deliver both more powerful mobile hardware and fast global
access to most of us, the ability to virtually manage your life increases. But
the problem inherent with that is the confusion of managing the traf fic that
ensues with all the options available on your mobile device(s). W ithout a
good capturing, clarifying, and or ganizing methodology in place, with the
appropriate applications and tools structured to handle it as it happens, the
new world of global mobile access will be underutilized, if not a source of
unproductive distraction and stress itself.
Don’t Shar e Space!
It is imperative that you have your own workspace—or at least your own
in-tray and a place in which to process paper and physical material. T oo
many couples I’ve worked with have tried to work out of a single desk at
home, and it always makes light-years of dif ference when they expand to
two workstations. Far from being the “separation” they expect, the move in
fact relieves them of a subtle stress in their relationship about managing the
stuf f of their shared lives. One couple even decided to set up an additional
mini-workstation in the kitchen for the stay-at-home mom, so she could
process work while keeping an eye on their infant in the family room.
Y ou need to use your system—not continually have to re-create it.
Some or ganizations are interested in the concept of “hotel-ing”—that is,
having people create totally self-contained and mobile workstation
capabilities so they can “plug in” anywhere in the company , at any time,
and work from there. That can provide savings in of fice space requirements,
as companies operate more virtually with a workforce that can function
independently from the “mother ship.” But that presupposes that each
worker involved has a locus of control on his or her own. Experiments have
failed in this scheme, because they disrupted the stable workstation. There
must be zero resistance to using the systems we have. Having to continually
reinvent our in-tray , our filing system, and how and where we process our
stuf f (“Where’ s a darn Post-it, and a stapler?!”) can only be a source of
incessant distraction.
Y ou can work virtually anywhere if you have a clean, compact system and
know how to process your stuf f rapidly and portably . But you’ll still need a
home base with a well-grooved set of tools and suf ficient space for all the
reference and support material that you’ll want somewhere close at hand
when you land. Most people I work with need at least two file drawers for
their general-reference and project-support types of paper -based materials.
Given digital scanners and the continual technology advances in this regard,
it is conceivable that one day all that support material can be in the cloud
and retrievable as needed, anywhere. But it will still be a while before you
don’ t need your physical passport, EU cash you brought back from your trip
to Milan, and temporary paper -based documentation of all sorts that
remains the optimum way to handle some data. Big or small, that inventory
of reference and collateral items needs a home, with easy access to it.
Getting the T ools Y ou’ll Need
If you’re committed to a full implementation of this workflow process,
there are some basic supplies and equipment that you’ll need to get you
started. As you go along, you’re likely to dance between using what you’re
used to and evaluating any possibilities for new and dif ferent gear to work
with.
Note that good tools don’ t necessarily have to be expensive. Often, on the
low-tech side, the more “executive” something looks, the more
dysfunctional it really is.
The Basic Pr ocessing T ools
Let’ s assume you’re starting from scratch. In addition to a desktop
workspace, you’ll need:
Paper -holding trays (at least three)
A stack of plain letter -size paper
A pen/pencil
Post-its (3×3"s)
Paper clips
A stapler and staples
Scotch tape
Rubber bands
An automatic labeler
File folders
A calendar
W astebasket/recycling bins
Current tools being used for data capture, or ganizing, and to-do lists,
including mobile devices, personal computers, and paper -based planners
and notebooks (if any)
Paper -Holding T rays
These will serve as your in-tray and out-tray , with one or two others for
work-in-progress support papers and/or your read-and-review stack. The
most functional trays are the side-facing letter - or legal-sized stackable
kinds, which have no
“lip” on them to keep you from sliding out a single piece of paper .
Plain Paper
Y ou’ll use plain paper for the initial collection process. Believe it or not,
putting one thought on one full-size sheet of paper can have enormous
value. Most people will wind up processing their notes into some sort of list
or ganizer , but by having initial thoughts separated into discrete placeholders
(versus on one amorphous list), it makes it easier to wrestle it to closure
later , in the processing and or ganizing steps. In any case, it’ s important to
have plenty of letter -size writing paper or tablets around to make capturing
ad hoc input easy .
Post-its, Clips, Stapler , Etc.
Moment-to-moment collecting, thinking, processing, and or ganizing are
challenging enough; always ensure that you have the tools to make them as
easy as possible.
Post-its, clips, stapler , tape, and rubber bands will come in handy for
routing and storing paper -based materials. Though their use is diminishing,
we’re not finished with paper and other physical materials yet (if you
haven’ t noticed!), and the simple tools for managing them are essential.
Labeler
The labeler is a surprisingly useful tool in this process. Thousands of people
we have worked with now have their own automatic labelers, and our
archives are full of their comments, like “Incredible—I wouldn’ t have
believed what a dif ference it makes!” The labeler will be used to label file
folders, binder spines, and numerous other things.
I prefer a stand-alone tool or a simple plug-and-play labeler for the
computer that can make single labels in the moment, reducing any friction
to filing something when it shows up.
File Folders
Y ou’ll need plenty of file folders. Y ou may also need an equal number of
file-folder hangers, if your filing system requires them. Plain-colored
folders are fine
—color -coding is a level of complexity that’ s hardly ever worth the ef fort.
Y our general-reference filing system should just be a simple library .*
Calendar
Although you may not need a calendar just to collect your incomplete
items, you’ll certainly come up with actions that need to be put there,
nonetheless. As I noted earlier , the calendar should be used not to hold
action lists but to track the
“hard landscape” of things that have to get done on a specific day or at a
specific time.
Most professionals these days already have some sort of working calendar
system in place, ranging from loose-leaf or ganizers to mobile devices to
shared enterprise software applications.
The calendar has often been the central tool that people rely on to be
“or ganized.” It’ s certainly a critical component in managing particular kinds
of data and reminders of the commitments and information that relate to
specific times and days. There are many reminders and some data that you
will want a calendar for , but you won’ t be stopping there: your calendar will
need to be integrated with a much more comprehensive system that will
emer ge as you apply this method.
Y ou may wonder what kind of calendar would be best to use, and I’ll
discuss that in more detail in the next chapter . For now , just keep using the
one you’ve got. After you develop a feel for the whole systematic approach,
you’ll have a better reference point for deciding about graduating to a
dif ferent tool.
W astebasket/Recycling Bins
If you’re like most people, when you implement this process you’re going
to toss a lot more stuf f than you expect, so get ready to create a good bit of
trash. Some executives I have coached have found it extremely useful to
arrange for a lar ge trash bin to be parked immediately outside their of fices
the day we work together!
Do Y ou Need an Organizer?
Once you know how to process your stuf f and what to or ganize, you really
just need to create and manage lists.
Whether or not you need an or ganizer tool, and if so, what kind, will
depend on a number of factors. Are you already committed to using
something for managing lists and at-hand reference information? How do
you want to see your reminders of actions, agendas, and projects? Where
and how often do you need to review them? Because your head is not the
place in which to hold things, you’ll obviously need something to manage
your triggers and orient yourself externally . Y ou could maintain everything
in a purely low-tech fashion, by keeping pieces of paper in folders. Or you
could even use a paper -based notebook or planner , or a digital version
thereof. Or you could employ some combination of these.
All of the low-tech gear listed in the previous section is used for various
aspects of collecting, processing, and or ganizing. Y ou’ll use a tray and
random paper for collecting. As you process your in-tray , you’ll complete
many less-than-two-minute actions that will require Post-its, a stapler , and
paper clips. The magazines, articles, and paper reports and documents that
are your longer -than-two-minute reading will go in another of the trays.
And you’ll probably have quite a bit just to file away . What’ s left—
maintaining a project inventory , logging calendar items and action and
agenda reminders, and tracking the things you’re waiting for—will require
some form of lists, or reviewable groupings of similar items.
Lists can be managed in a low-tech way , as pieces of paper kept in a file
folder (e.g., separate sheets/notes for each person you need to call in a Calls
file, or bills to pay in a T o Pay folder or tray), or they can be arranged in a
more mid-tech fashion, in loose-leaf notebooks or planners (a page titled
Calls with the names listed down the sheet). Or they can be high-tech,
digital versions (such as a Calls category in the T asks or T o-Do section of a
software application).
In addition to holding portable reference material (e.g., contact info) most
or ganizing tools are designed for managing lists. (Y our calendar is actually
a form of a list, with time- and day-specific action reminders listed
chronologically .)
One of the best tricks for enhancing your productivity is having or ganizing
tools you love to use.
Probably thousands of types of or ganizers have been on the market since
the latter twentieth century , from the early Day-T imers and Filofaxes, to the
more sophisticated planners like T ime/system and FranklinCovey , to the
retro use of a simple Moleskine notebook, to the current flood of task-
management software applications. *
Should you implement the Getting Things Done  process in what you’re
currently using, or should you install something new? The answer is, do
whichever one will actually help you change your behavior so you’ll use
the tools appropriately . There are ef ficiency factors to consider here, too.
Do you get a lot of digital information that would be easier to track with a
digital tool? Do you need a paper -based calendar for all the appointments
you have to make and change rapidly on the run? Where and how is the
easiest way for you to be reminded of calls you need to make when you’re
moving fast? And so on. There are also the aesthetic and enjoyment factors.
I’ve done some of my best planning and updating for myself when I simply
wanted some excuse to use (i.e., play with) my smartphone while waiting
for dinner alone in a restaurant!
If your reference system is not under control, it creates a blockage in your
workflow that causes amorphous content to back up into your world.
Keep in mind, though, that the tool you use will not give you stress-free
productivity . That is something you  create by implementing the GTD
method.
The structure you incorporate will  be extremely important in how you
express and implement the process, but it is not a substitute for it. A great
hammer doesn’ t make a great carpenter; but a great carpenter will always
want to have a great hammer .
When considering whether to get and use any or ganizing tool, and if so,
which one, keep in mind that all you really need to do is manage lists.
Y ou’ve got to be able to create a list on the run and review it easily and as
regularly as you need to. Once you know what to put on the lists and how to
use them, the medium really doesn’ t matter . Just go for simplicity , speed,
and fun.
The Critical Factor of a Filing System
Y ou will resist the whole process of capturing information if your reference
systems are not fast, functional, and fun.
A simple and highly functional personal reference system is critical to this
process. The filing system at hand is one of the first things I assess before
beginning the workflow process in anyone’ s of fice. As I noted in chapter 2,
the lack of a good general-reference system can be one of the greatest
obstacles to implementing a personal management system, and for most of
the executives I have coached, it represents one of the biggest opportunities
for improvement.
It’ s not because the content is so important or strategic—it’ s rather that,
unmanaged, it inordinately clouds physical and mental space. Random
nonactionable but potentially relevant material, unprocessed and
unor ganized, produces a debilitating psychological noise. More important,
it produces a block in the “flow” part of workflow , and things tend to back
up into the area like we see with clogged plumbing. Many times I have
driven to the local of fice-supply store with a client and bought a filing
cabinet, a big stack of file folders, and a labeler , just so we could create an
appropriate place in which to put two-thirds of the stuf f lying around his or
her desk and of fice. The transformation in clarity and focus regarding work
was inevitably dramatic.
W e’re concerned here mostly with general-reference filing—as distinct
from discrete filing systems devoted to contracts, financial information,
patient records, or other categories of data that deserve their own place and
indexing.
General-reference files should hold articles, brochures, pieces of paper ,
notes, printouts, documents, and even physical things like tickets, keys,
buyers-club membership cards, and flash drives—basically anything that
you want to keep for its interesting or useful data or purpose and that
doesn’ t fit into your specialized filing systems and won’ t stand up by itself
on a shelf (as will lar ge software manuals and seminar binders).
If you are a digitally oriented person, you may think there’ s no longer any
need for file folders for physical stuf f. At some point in the future, I may
not need a physical passport, birth certificate, older kitchen appliance
instructions, medical records, keys for seldom-used boxes, or paper
currency from countries I will revisit. But until then, I need a coordinated
physical place to park them.
T o captur e what you experience and sort it out . . . you must set up a file. . .
. Whenever you feel  str ongly about events or ideas you must try not to let
them pass fr om your mind, but instead to
formulate them for your files and in so doing draw out their implications,
show yourself how  foolish these feelings or ideas ar e, or how they might be
articulated into pr oductive shape.
—C. W right Mills
If you have a trusted secretary or assistant who maintains that system for
you, so you can put a “File as X” Post-it on the document and send it out to
him or her , great. But ask yourself if you have some potentially interesting,
confidential, or useful support material that should be accessible at any
moment, even when your assistant isn’ t around. If so, you’ll still need your
own system in your desk or somewhere near it.
The same dynamic holds true, whether reference is in paper or digital form.
As more and more information is coming to us virtually , the need to have
general-reference locations for ad hoc data on your computer or mobile
device is critical. Many people are still using their e-mail in-tray area as an
amorphous general-reference storage place (“I need to keep this e-mail
because it has information about my son’ s school event schedule”), but they
resist making an electronic folder named “Robert” or “School schedules” in
their e-mail application in which to drag and store it, or copying and pasting
it in a good reference storage program or database. Software is now
available that allows capturing and categorizing this kind of information
(and synchronizing it with multiple devices), but it does require some
thought about how to structure it, as well as some directed behavior to flow
this kind of stuf f into appropriate places instead of complicating and
confusing your digital environment. When I instituted a new general-
reference filing application on my computer , it required a good three
months of my experimentation to find the optimal way to or ganize it, and
another three months to get it on “cruise control,” so now I’m just using it
instead of thinking so much about  it.
Success Factors for Filing
I strongly suggest that you maintain a personal, at-hand filing system—both
physical and digital. It should take you less than one minute to pick
something up out of your in-tray or print it from e-mail, decide it needs no
next action but has some potential future value, and finish storing it in a
trusted system. The same is true for scanning and storing documents or
copying and pasting information in the computer . Y ou may have a
preponderance of digital over
paper -based reference material (or vice versa), but without a streamlined
system for both, you will resist keeping potentially valuable information, or
what you do keep will accumulate in inappropriate places. If it takes longer
than a minute to file something in an easily retrievable format, you’ll likely
stack it or stuf f it somewhere instead. Besides being fast, the system needs
to be fun and easy , current and complete. Otherwise you’ll unconsciously
resist emptying your in-tray because you know there’ s likely to be
something in there that ought to get filed, and you won’ t even want to look
at the papers or your clogged e-mail.
T ake heart: I’ve seen people go from resisting to actually enjoying sorting
through their piles and digital world once their personal filing system is set
up and humming.
Y ou must feel equally comfortable about filing a single piece of paper on a
new topic—even a scribbled note—in its own file as you would about filing
a more formal, lar ger document. Because it requires so much work to make
and or ganize files, people either don’ t keep them or have junked-up
cabinets and drawers full of all sorts of one-of-a-kind items, like menus for
the local takeout café or the current train schedule. If you trust that all that
kind of information is instantly and virtually available through the W eb and
you would never need to access hard copies, then make sure you’re not
duplicating systems unnecessarily , and that what you choose and how you
use it is seamless.
Whatever you need to do to get your reference system to that quick and
easy standard for everything it has to hold, do it. My system works
wonderfully for me and for many others who try it, and I highly recommend
that you consider incorporating all of the following guidelines to really
make reference filing automatic.
Keep Y our General-Refer ence Files Immediately at Hand Filing has to be
instantaneous and easy . If you have to get up every time you have some ad
hoc piece of paper you want to file, or you have to search multiple places
on your computer for an appropriate location for a piece of information you
want to keep, you’ll tend to stack it or leave it in its original place instead of
filing it.
Y ou’re also likely to resist the whole in-tray process (because you know
there’ s stuf f in there that might need filing!). Many people I have coached
have redesigned their of fice space so they have plenty of general-reference
file drawers literally within swivel distance, instead of across the room.
One Alpha System I have one A–Z alphabetical physical filing system for
general reference, not multiple ones. My e-mail reference folders are also
or ganized this way . People have a tendency to want to use their files as a
personal management system, and therefore they attempt to or ganize them
in groupings by projects or areas of focus. This magnifies geometrically the
number of places something isn’ t  when you for get where you filed it. Once
you have filtered all the reminders for actions into your next-action lists,
this kind of data is simply the content of your personal library . Y ou should
have the freedom to be as much of a pack rat as you wish. The only issue
you need to deal with is how much room you have for storage, and how
accessible the information is when you need it. One simple alpha system
files everything by topic, person, project, or company , so it can be in only
three or four places if you for get exactly where you put it. Y ou can usually
put at least one subset of topics on each label, like “Gardening—pots” and
“Gardening—ideas.” These would be filed under G.
Using an ef fectively simple and easily accessible general-reference filing
system gives you the freedom to keep as much information as you want.
The digital world provides the advantage of the search function across a
wide swath of your data, and the ability to tag content with key words adds
even more capability for retrieval. However , with so many options and
locations for data storage, that power also can easily add complexity and
confusion. Most people I know who are even moderately busy won’ t take
the time and ef fort to use these tools to catalog all their stuf f within all their
possible applications. So, though the computer gives us great power and
flexibility and opportunity for a great reference library , it creates an even
greater challenge to design your own simple and ef fective formats for
referential information. Even digitally , it is very helpful to have a visual
map sorted in ways that make sense—either by indexes or data groups
or ganized ef fectively , usually in an alpha format. T o find restaurants in
London that I like, I go my current general-reference application, where I
find
“Locales,” then “London,” then “Restaurants”—all alphabetized within
each level of abstraction.
The biggest issue for digitally oriented people is that the ease of capturing
and storing has generated a write-only syndrome: all they’re doing is
capturing information—not actually accessing and using it intelligently .
Some consciousness needs to be applied to keep one’ s potentially huge
digital library functional, versus a black hole of data easily dumped in there
with a couple of
keystrokes. “I don’ t need to or ganize my stuf f, because the search feature
can find it suf ficiently” is, from what I’ve experienced, quite suboptimal as
an approach. W e need to have a way to overview our mass of collected
information with some form of ef fective categorization.
Every once in a while someone has such a huge amount of reference
material on one topic or project that it should be put in its own discrete
drawer , cabinet, or digital directory . But if the physical material is less than
half a file drawer ’ s worth, I recommend including it in the single general
alphabetical system. And if it is a digital grouping, it perhaps deserves its
own place as a subdirectory .
Make It Easy to Cr eate a New Folder I keep a lar ge supply of new file
folders instantly at hand and reachable from where I sit to process my in-
tray . Nothing is worse than having something to file and not having plenty
of folders to grab from to make the process easy . Always ensure a supply
within reach. The virtual version of this is getting comfortable with how to
instantly create a new directory in your data-storage software as needed.
Make Sur e Y ou Have Plenty of Space for Easy Storage Always try to keep
your physical file drawers less than three-quarters full. If they’re stuf fed,
you’ll unconsciously resist putting things in there, and reference materials
will tend to stack up instead. If a drawer is starting to get tight, I may pur ge
it while I’m on hold on the phone. If you have any attention on the storage
room in your digital devices, it’ s a good time to review and pur ge.
I know almost no one who doesn’ t have overstuf fed file drawers. If you
value your cuticles, and if you want to get rid of your unconscious
resistance to filing, then you must keep the drawers loose enough that you
can insert and retrieve files without ef fort. The digital version of this is
having any concern about space on the computer or in the cloud. A
judgment call you consistently have to make is how much room to give
yourself so that the content remains meaningfully and easily accessible,
without creating a black hole of an inordinate amount of information
amorphously or ganized. At times when I’m on hold on the phone, I’m
pur ging my e-mail folders and old document directories.
Some people’ s reaction to this is, “I’d have to buy more file cabinets!” or
“I’d have to get a lar ger hard drive!” as if that were something horrible. But
if the stuf f is worth keeping, it’ s worth keeping so that it’ s easily accessible,
right?
And if it’ s not, then why are you keeping it? If we’re in the Information
Age, and you’re doing anything  that hinders your usage of it . . . not smart.
Y ou may need to create another tier of reference storage to give yourself
suf ficient working room with your general-reference files at hand. Material
such as finished project notes and “dead” client files may still need to be
kept, but they can be stored of f-site, on storage drives, in the cloud, or at
least out of your workspace.
Label Y our File Folders with an Auto Labeler No matter how small your
inventory of physical reference materials is, you need to stay positively
engaged with it. T ypeset labels change the nature of your physical files and
your relationship to them. Labeled files feel comfortable on a boardroom
table; everyone can identify them; you can easily see what they are from a
distance and in your briefcase; and when you open your file drawers, you
get to see what looks almost like a printed index of your files in
alphabetical order . It makes it fun to open the drawer to find or insert
things.
Things you name, you own. Collected but unnamed stuf f owns you.
Perhaps later in this new millennium the brain scientists will give us some
esoteric and complex neurological explanation for why labeled files work
so ef fectively . Until then, trust me. Get a labeler . And get your own. T o
make the whole system work without a hitch, you’ll need to have it at hand
all the time, so you can file something whenever you want. And don’ t
share! If you have something to file and your labeler ’ s not there, you’ll just
stack the material instead of filing it. The labeler should be as basic a tool
as your stapler .
In the fire zone of real work, if it takes longer than sixty seconds to file
something where it belongs, you won’ t file, you’ll “stack.”
Pur ge Y our Files at Least Once a Y ear Cleaning house in your files
regularly keeps them from going stale and seeming like a black hole, and it
also gives you the freedom to keep anything on a whim “in case you might
need it.” Y ou know everything will be reassessed within a few months
anyway , and you can redecide then what’ s worth keeping and what isn’ t.
This applies equally to digital as well as paper -based reference information.
As I said, I pur ge my files while I’m on hold on the phone (or marking time
on a conference call that’ s dragging on and
on!).
I recommend that all or ganizations (if they don’ t have one already)
establish a “pur ge day ,” when all employees get to come to work in jeans,
put their phone on do-not-disturb, and get current with all their stored
stuf f .* Lar ge trash bins, recycle containers, and “to shred” boxes are
available, and everyone has permission to spend the whole day in pur ge
mode—around their of fice and on their computer . A personal pur ge day is
an ideal thing to put into your tickler file, either during the holidays, at
year ’ s end, or around early spring tax-preparation time, when you might
want to tie it in with archiving the previous year ’ s financial files.
Filing as a Success Factor Itself
Reference and support materials seldom are associated with ur gency , nor
are they strategic, in the grand scheme of things. Hence their management
is very often relegated to a low priority , if dealt with at all. The problem,
however , is that your mental and physical workspaces become cluttered
with nonactionable but potentially relevant and useful stuf f. “What is this?”
“Why is this here?”
“What should I do with this?” and “Where is what I need to access right
now?”
become subliminal voices plaguing the consciousness if this aspect of your
world is not rigorously set up and maintained.
Wherever items of dif ferent character or meaning are piled into the same
location, it’ s too much work to continually think about the nature of the
contents, so your brain will go numb to the pile.
Reference materials need to be contained and or ganized within their own
discrete boundaries—physically and digitally—so that they don’ t cloud
other categories in your system, are available for a specific purpose, and
can be accessed ef ficiently . Because they can be so voluminous, it is critical
that they be easily managed for capturing, sorting, and accessing what you
need, when you need it, and that they don’ t get in the way of the more
action-oriented components of your system. I have spent countless hours
with some of the most sophisticated professionals in the world, assisting
them in cleaning up and setting up a simple and functional reference
system, and the results have often been phenomenal in freeing up their
attention for the bigger things.
One Final Thing to Prepare . . .
Y ou’ve blocked of f some time, you’ve gotten a work area set up, and
you’ve got the basic tools to start implementing the methodology . Now
what?
If you’ve decided to commit a certain amount of time to setting up your
workflow system, there’ s one more thing that you’ll need to do to make it
maximally ef fective: you must clear the decks of any other commitments
for the duration of the session.
If there’ s someone you absolutely need to call, or something your secretary
has to handle for you or you have to check with your life partner about, do
it now . Or make an agreement with yourself about when you will  do it, and
then put some reminder of that where you won’ t miss it. It’ s critical that
your full attention be available for the work at hand.
Almost without exception, when I sit down to begin coaching people, even
though they’ve blocked out time and committed significant money to utilize
me as a resource for that time, they still have things they’re going to have to
do before we quit for the day , and they haven’ t arranged for them yet in
their own systems. “Oh, yeah, I’ve got to call this client back sometime
today ,” they’ll say , or “I have to check in with my spouse to see if he’ s
gotten the tickets for tonight.” It bespeaks a certain lack of awareness and
maturity in our culture, I think, that so many sophisticated people are
ignoring those levels of responsibility to their own consciousness, on an
ongoing operational basis.
So have you handled all that? Good. Now it’ s time to gather representatives
of all of your open loops into one place.
