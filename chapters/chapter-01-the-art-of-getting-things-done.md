The Art of Getting Things Done

A New Practice for a New Reality
Ther e is one thing we can do, and the happiest people ar e those who can do
it to the limit of  their ability . W e can be completely pr esent. W e can be all
her e. W e can give . . . our attention to  the opportunity befor e us.
—Mark V an Dor en
IT’S POSSIBLE FOR a person to have an overwhelming number of things
to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of
relaxed control.
That’ s a great way to live and work, at elevated levels of ef fectiveness and
ef ficiency . It’ s also the best way to be fully present with whatever you’re
doing, appropriately engaged in the moment. It’ s when time disappears, and
your attention is completely at your command. What you’re doing is exactly
what you ought to be doing, given the whole spectrum of your commitments
and interests.
Y ou’re fully available. Y ou’re “on.”
This is an operational style now critical for successful, high-performing
professionals; a necessary mode for the sanity of anyone experiencing
overextended life situations; and a fundamental platform to allow all of us
the freedom to involve ourselves optimally in our most meaningful
endeavors.
Y ou already know how to do everything necessary to achieve this healthy ,
high-performance state. If you’re like most people, however , you need to
apply these skills in a more timely , complete, and systematic way so you can
get on top of it all instead of feeling buried. And though the method and the
techniques I describe in this book are immensely practical and based on
common sense, most people will have some major habits that must be
modified before they can fully enjoy the benefits of this system. The small
changes required—changes in the way you clarify and or ganize all the things
that command your attention—
could represent a significant alteration in how you approach some key
aspects of
your day-to-day activities. But the results are often reported as
transformational.
The methods I present here are all based on three key objectives: (1)
capturing all  the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for
you—
now , later , someday , big, little, or in between—in a logical and trusted
system outside your head and of f your mind; (2) directing yourself to make
front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you
will always have a workable inventory of “next actions” that you can
implement or renegotiate in the moment; and (3) curating and coordinating
all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of
commitments with yourself and others you will have at play , at any point in
time.
This book of fers a proven method for this kind of high-performance
workflow management. It provides good tools, tips, techniques, and tricks
for implementation. As you’ll discover , the principles and methods are
instantly usable and applicable to everything you have to do in your personal
as well as your professional life. * Y ou can incorporate, as many others have
before you, what I describe as an ongoing dynamic style of operating in your
work and in your world. Or , like still others, you can simply use this as a
guide to getting back into better control when you feel you need to.
The Problem: New Demands, Insuf ficient Resources
Almost everyone I encounter these days feels he or she has too much to
handle and not enough time to get it all done. In the course of a single week,
I consulted with a partner in a major global investment firm who was
concerned that the new corporate-management responsibilities he was being
of fered would stress his family commitments beyond the limits; and with a
midlevel human resources manager trying to stay on top of her 150-plus e-
mail requests per day fueled by the goal of doubling the company’ s regional
of fice staf f from eleven hundred to two thousand people in one year , all as
she tried to protect a social life for herself on the weekends.
A paradox has emer ged in this new millennium: people have enhanced
quality of life, but at the same time they are adding to their stress levels by
taking on more than they have resources to handle. It’ s as though their eyes
were bigger than their stomachs. The plethora of options and opportunities
brings with it the pressures of decision making and choices. And most
people are to some degree frustrated and perplexed about how to improve
the situation.
W ork No Longer Has Clear Boundaries
A major factor in the mounting stress level is that the actual nature of our
jobs has changed much more dramatically and rapidly than have our training
for and our ability to deal with work. In just the last half of the twentieth
century , what constituted “work” in the industrialized world was transformed
from assembly line, make-it-and-move-it kinds of activity to what the late
Peter Drucker so aptly termed “knowledge” work.
In the old days, work was self-evident. Fields were to be plowed, machines
tooled, boxes packed, cows milked, crates moved. Y ou knew what work had
to be done—you could see it. It was clear when the work was finished, or
not finished. Increasing your productivity was all about making the work
process more ef ficient, or simply working harder or longer .
Almost every project could be done better , and an infinite quantity of
information is now available that could make that happen.
Now , for many of us, there are no edges to most of our projects. Most people
I know have at least half a dozen things they’re trying to achieve or
situations they’d like to improve right now , and even if they had the rest of
their lives to try , they wouldn’ t be able to finish these to perfection. Y ou’re
probably faced with the same dilemma. How good could that conference be?
How ef fective could the training program be, or the structure of your
executives’ compensation package? How well could you manage your kids’
education? How close to perfect is the blog you’re writing? How motivating
is the staf f meeting you’re setting up? How healthy could you be? How
functional is your department’ s reor ganization? And a last question: How
much available data could be relevant to doing those projects “better”? The
answer is: an infinite amount, easily accessible, or at least potentially so,
through the Internet.
On another front, the lack of edges can create mor e  work for everyone.
Many of today’ s or ganizational outcomes require cross-divisional
communication, cooperation, and engagement. Our individual of fice silos
are crumbling (or at least need to be), and with them is going the luxury of
not having to read cc’d e-mails from the marketing department, or from
human resources, or from some ad hoc, deal-with-a-certain-issue committee.
Add to that the increasing pull on your engagement with friends and family
as distance from them disappears, with even
aging parents taking to the Internet and their smartphones to “stay
connected.”
The ever -new communication technologies have exponentially magnified the
lack of clear limits to our commitments and our lives. The second decade of
this century witnessed an explosion of concern about the always-on
conundrum, fueled by globalization (“half my team is in Hong Kong, and
another key person in Estonia”), virtual work and connection capabilities,
and not the least by the addiction to engaging with gadgets in our pockets
and on our wrists that have more capacity than a room full of computers did
in 1975.
So, not only are work and its cognitive boundaries more ambiguous and ill
defined, so are the time and space within which we can (and often should) be
engaged with it, along with the continuing explosion of potentially
meaningful and accessible data that could add value to our lives.
Our Jobs (and Lives) Keep Changing
The disintegrating edges of our projects and our work in general would be
challenging enough for anyone. But now we must add to that equation the
constantly shifting definition of our jobs, as well as the frequent changes in
responsibilities and interests in the broader scope of our lives.
Most of us have, in the past seventy-two hours, received more change-
producing, project-creating, and priority-shifting inputs than our parents did
in a month, maybe even in a year .
I often ask in my seminar , “Which of you are doing only what you were
hired to do? And how many of you have not had any significant change in
your personal life in the past year?” Seldom do I get a raised hand. As
amorphous as edgeless work may be, if you had the chance to stick with
some specifically described job long enough, you’d probably figure out what
you needed to do—
how much, at what level—to stay sane. And if you could keep life in general
more in check—no residence moves, no relationship changes, no emer ging
health or lifestyle issues for you and for loved ones, no financial surprises,
no motivational programs generating inspiring new directions, no career
shifts thrust on you—you might be able to create a rhythm and system of
managing it that would allow for some relaxed stability .
W e can never r eally be pr epar ed for that which is wholly new . W e have to
adjust ourselves, and  every radical adjustment is a crisis in self-esteem; we
under go a test, we have to pr ove  ourselves. It needs subor dinate self-
confidence to face drastic change without inner tr embling.
—Eric Hoffer
But few have that luxury , for three reasons:
1 | Or ganizations are now almost universally in morph mode, with ever -
changing goals, products, partners, customers, markets, technologies, and
owners. These all, by necessity , shake up structures, forms, roles, and
accountabilities.
2 | The average professional is more of a free agent these days than ever
before, changing careers as often as his or her parents once changed jobs.
Even forty- and fiftysomethings hold to standards of continual growth.
Their aims are just more integrated into the mainstream now , covered by the
catch-all arena of “professional, management, and executive
development”—which simply means they won’ t keep doing what they’re
doing for any extended period of time .*
3 | The relative speed of changes in our cultures, lifestyles, and technologies
are creating greater necessity for individuals to take more control of their
unique personal situations, more often. Suddenly needing to handle eldercare
for a parent, dealing with a kid now back at home without a job, grappling
with an unexpected health issue, or integrating a major change one’ s life
partner has decided to initiate . . . all such seem to be happening with greater
frequency , with lar ger consequences, than ever before.
Little seems clear for very long anymore, as far as what to do at the of fice, at
home, on the plane, in the car , and at the local café—on the weekend, on
Monday morning, on waking at three a.m., and on “vacation”; and what or
how much input may be relevant to doing it well. W e’re allowing in huge
amounts of information and communication from the outer world and
generating an equally lar ge volume of ideas and agreements with others and
ourselves from the inner world. And we haven’ t been well equipped to deal
with this huge number of internal and external commitments.
Nothing is really new in this high-tech, globally wired world, except how
fr equently  it is. When the pace of change in life and work was much slower ,
once people got past the inevitable discomfort of the new , they could hang
out
on cruise control for greatly extended periods of time. Most of us are now
living in a world that does not af ford that time-out kind of luxury . It’ s
changing while you’re reading this. And if, while you have  been reading
this, you’ve been distracted by your mind wandering to other things going
on in your life, or you’ve felt impelled to check e-mail for potentially
meaningful new input, you’re experiencing a manifestation of this don’ t-
miss-the-train syndrome.
The Old Models and Habits Ar e Insufficient
Neither our standard education, nor traditional time-management models,
nor the plethora of digital and paper -based or ganizing tools available has
given us a viable means of meeting the new demands placed on us. If you’ve
tried to use any of these processes or tools, you’ve probably found them
unable to accommodate the speed, complexity , and changing priority factors
inherent in what you are doing. The ability to be focused, relaxed, and in
control during these fertile but turbulent and often unstructured times
demands new ways of thinking and working. There is a great need for new
methods, technologies, and work habits to help us get on top of our world.
The traditional approaches to time management and personal or ganization
were useful in their time. They provided helpful reference points for a
workforce that was just emer ging from an industrial assembly-line modality
into a new kind of work that included choices about what to do and
discretion about when to do it. When time itself turned into a work factor ,
personal calendars became a key work tool. (Even in the 1980s many
professionals considered having a pocket calendar the essence of being
or ganized, and many people today still think of their calendar and possibly
their e-mail and text in-boxes as the central tools for being in control.) Along
with discretionary time came the need to make good choices about what to
do. Creating “ABC” priority codes and daily “to-do” lists were key
techniques developed to help people sort through their choices in some
meaningful way . If you had the freedom to decide what to do, you also had
the responsibility to make good choices, given your priorities.
What you’ve probably discovered, at least at some level, is that a calendar ,
though important, can really ef fectively manage only a small portion of what
you need to be aware of to feel on top of your world. And daily to-do lists
and simplified priority coding have proven inadequate in dealing with the
volume and variable nature of the average person’ s workload. More and
more people’ s
jobs and lives are made up of hundreds of e-mails and texts a day , with no
latitude left to ignore a single request, complaint, order , or communication
from company or family . There are few people who can (or even should)
expect to code everything based upon its priority , or who can maintain some
predetermined list of to-dos that the first telephone call or instant message or
interruption from their boss or spouse won’ t totally un  do.
The Big Pictur e vs. the Nitty-Gritty
The winds and waves ar e always on the side of the ablest navigators.
—Edwar d Gibbon
At the other end of the spectrum, a huge number of business books, models,
seminars, and gurus have championed the “bigger view” as the solution to
dealing with our complex world. Clarifying major goals and values, so the
thinking goes, gives order , meaning, and direction to our work. In practice,
however , the well-intentioned exercise of values thinking too often does not
achieve its desired results. I have seen too many of these ef forts fail, for one
or more of the following three reasons:
1 | There is too much distraction at the day-to-day , hour -to-hour level of
commitments to allow for appropriate focus on the higher levels.
2 | Inef fective personal or ganizational systems create huge subconscious
resistance to undertaking even bigger projects and goals that will likely not
be managed well, and that will in turn cause even more distraction and
stress.
3 | When loftier levels and values actually are clarified, it raises the bar of
our standards, making us notice that much more that needs changing. W e are
already having a serious negative reaction to the overwhelming number of
things we have to do. And what created much of the work that’ s on those
lists in the first place? Our values!
Focusing on primary outcomes and values is  a critical exercise, certainly . It
provides needed criteria for making sometimes-dif ficult choices about what
to
stop  doing, as well as what most ought to have our attention amid our excess
of options. But it does not mean that there is less to do, or fewer challenges
in getting the work done. Quite the contrary: it just ups the ante in the game,
which still must be played day to day . For a human resources executive, for
example, deciding to deal with quality-of-work-life issues in order to attract
and keep key talent does not  make things simpler . Nor would there be less to
do for a mother recognizing the importance of providing valuable
experiences for her teenage daughter in the few vacations left they may take
together before she leaves home for work or college. Upping the quality of
our thinking and commitments does not diminish the quantity of potentially
relevant and important stuf f to manage.
Chaos isn’ t the pr oblem; how long it takes to find coher ence is the r eal
game.
—Doc Childr e and Bruce Cryer
There has been a missing piece in our culture of knowledge work: a system
with a coherent set of behaviors and tools that functions ef fectively at the
level at which work really happens. It must incorporate the results of big-
picture thinking as well as the smallest of open details. It must manage
multiple tiers of priorities. It must maintain control over hundreds of new
inputs daily . It must save a lot more time and ef fort than are needed to
maintain it. It must make it easier to get things done.
The Promise: The “Ready State” of the Martial Artist
Reflect for a moment on what it actually might be like if your personal
management situation were totally under control, at all levels and at all
times.
What if you had completely clear mental space, with nothing pulling or
pushing on you unproductively? What if you could dedicate fully 100
percent of your attention to whatever was at hand, at your own choosing,
with no distraction?
It is  possible. There is  a way to get a grip on it all, stay relaxed, and get
meaningful things done with minimal ef fort, across the whole spectrum of
your life and work. Y ou can  experience what the martial artists call a “mind
like water” and top athletes refer to as the “zone,” within the complex world
in which you’re engaged. In fact, you have probably already been in this
state from time to time.
Life is denied by lack of attention, whether it be to cleaning windows or
trying to write a  masterpiece.
—Nadia Boulanger
It’ s a condition of working, doing, and being in which the mind is clear and
constructive things are happening. It’ s a state that is accessible to everyone,
and one that is increasingly needed to deal ef fectively with the complexity of
life in this century . More and more it will be a required condition for any of
us who wish to maintain balance and a consistent positive output in our work
and outlook in our life. W orld-class rower Craig Lambert has described how
it feels in Mind Over W ater (Houghton Mif flin, 1998):
Rowers have a wor d for this frictionless state: swing. . . . Recall the pur e joy
of riding on a backyar d swing: an easy cycle of motion, the momentum
coming fr om the swing itself. The swing carries us; we do not for ce it. W e
pump our legs to drive our ar c higher , but gravity does most of the work. W e
ar e not so much swinging as being swung. The boat swings you. The shell
wants to move fast: Speed sings in its lines and natur e. Our job is simply to
work with the shell, to stop holding it back with our thrashing struggles to
go  faster . T rying too har d sabotages boat speed. T rying becomes striving and
striving undoes itself. Social climbers strive to be aristocrats but their efforts
pr ove them no such thing. Aristocrats do not strive; they have alr eady
arrived. Swing is a state of arrival.
The “Mind Like W ater” Simile
In karate there is an image that’ s used to define the position of perfect
readiness:
“mind like water .” Imagine throwing a pebble into a still pond. How does the
water respond? The answer is, totally appropriately to the force and mass of
the input; then it returns to calm. It doesn’ t overreact or underreact.
Y our ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to
relax.
W ater is what it is, and does what it does. It can overwhelm, but it’ s not
overwhelmed. It can be still, but it is not impatient. It can be forced to
change course, but it is not frustrated. Get it?
The power in a karate punch comes from speed, not muscle; it comes from a
focused “pop” at the end of the whip. That’ s why petite people can learn to
break boards and bricks with their hands: it doesn’ t take calluses or brute
strength; just the ability to generate a focused thrust with speed. But a tense
muscle is a slow one. So the high levels of training in the martial arts teach
and demand balance and relaxation as much as anything else. Clearing the
mind to being open and appropriately responsive is the key .
Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and
often does. Responding inappropriately to your e-mail, your thoughts about
what you need to do, your children, or your boss will lead to less ef fective
results than you’d like. Most people give either more or less attention to
things than they deserve, simply because they don’ t operate with a mind like
water .
Can Y ou Get into Y our “Pr oductive State” When Requir ed?
Think about the last time you felt highly productive. Y ou probably had a
sense of being in control, you were not stressed out, you were highly focused
on what you were doing, time tended to disappear (lunchtime already?), and
you felt you were making noticeable progress toward a meaningful outcome.
W ould you like to have more such experiences?
If your mind is empty , it is always r eady for anything; it is open for
everything.
—Shunryu Suzuki
And if you get seriously far out of that state—and start to feel out of control,
stressed out, unfocused, bored, and stuck—do you have the ability to get
yourself back into it? That’ s where the methodology of Getting Things Done
will have the greatest impact on your life, by showing you how to get back
to mind like water , with all your resources and faculties functioning at a
maximum level.
A challenge for many may be the lack of a reference point as to when they
fall out of the productive state. Most people have lived in a semistressful
experience
so consistently , for so long, they don’ t know that it could be quite dif ferent—
that there is another and more positive place from which to engage with their
world.
Hopefully this book will inspire you to raise the bar about how much
pressure you will allow yourself to tolerate, knowing you have the
techniques to reduce it.
The Principle: Dealing Ef fectively with Internal
Commitments
A basic truism I have discovered over decades of coaching and training
thousands of people is that most stress they experience comes from
inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept. Even those who
are not consciously “stressed out” will invariably experience greater
relaxation, better focus, and increased productive ener gy when they learn
more ef fectively to control the “open loops” of their lives.
Y ou’ve probably made many more agreements with yourself than you
realize, and every single one of them—big or little—is being tracked by a
less-than-conscious part of you. These are the “incompletes,” or “open
loops,” which I define as anything pulling at your attention that doesn’ t
belong where it is, the way it is. Open loops can include everything from
really big to-do items like
“End world hunger” to the more modest “Hire new assistant” to the tiniest
task such as “Replace porch lightbulb.”
Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop,”
which will be pulling on your attention if it’ s not appropriately managed.
In order to deal ef fectively with all of that, you must first identify and
capture all those things that are “ringing your bell” in some way , clarify
what, exactly , they mean to you, and then make a decision about how to
move on them. That may seem like a simple process, but in reality most
people don’ t do it in a consistent way . They lack the knowledge or the
motivation, or both, and most likely because they aren’ t aware of the prices
paid for neglecting that practice.
The Basic Requir ements for Managing Commitments
Managing commitments well requires the implementation of some basic
activities and behaviors:
First of all, if it’ s on your mind, your mind isn’ t clear . Anything you consider
unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your
mind, or what I call a collection tool, that you know you’ll come back to
regularly and sort through.
Second, you must clarify exactly what your commitment is and decide what
you have to do, if anything, to make progress toward fulfilling it.
Third, once you’ve decided on all the actions you need to take, you must
keep reminders of them or ganized in a system you review regularly .
Y ou must use  your mind to get things off  your mind.
An Important Exer cise to T est This Model
I suggest that you write down the project or situation that is most on your
mind at this moment. What most bugs you, distracts you, or interests you, or
in some other way consumes a lar ge part of your conscious attention? It may
be a project or problem that is really “in your face,” something you are being
pressed to handle, or a situation you feel you must deal with sooner rather
than later .
Maybe you have a holiday trip coming up that you need to make some major
last-minute decisions about. Y ou just read an e-mail about a new and
pressing issue in your department. Or perhaps you just inherited six million
dollars and you don’ t know what to do with the cash. Whatever .
Got it? Good. Now , describe, in a single written sentence, your intended
successful outcome for this problem or situation. In other words, what would
need to happen for you to check this project of f as “done”? It could be as
simple as “T ake the Hawaii vacation,” “Handle situation with customer X,”
“Resolve college situation with Susan,” “Clarify new divisional management
structure,”
“Implement new investment strategy ,” or “Research options for dealing with
Manuel’ s reading issue.” All clear? Great.
Now write down the very next physical action r equir ed to move the situation
forwar d . If you had nothing else to do in your life but get closure on this,
what visible action would you take right now? W ould you call or text
someone? W rite an e-mail? T ake pen and paper and brainstorm about it?
Surf the W eb for data?
Buy nails at the hardware store? T alk about it face-to-face with your partner ,
your assistant, your attorney , or your boss? What?
Got the answer to that? Good.
W as there any value for you in those two minutes of thinking? If you’re like
the vast majority of people who complete that drill in our seminars, you’ll be
experiencing at least a tiny bit of enhanced control, relaxation, and focus.
Y ou’ll also be feeling more motivated to actually do  something about that
situation you’ve merely been thinking about till now . Imagine that
motivation magnified a thousandfold, as a way to live and work.
Think like a man of action, act like a man of thought.
—Henri Ber gson
If anything at all positive happened for you in this little exercise, think about
this: What changed? What happened to create that improved condition
within your own experience? The situation itself is no further along, at least
in the physical world. It’ s certainly not finished yet. What probably
happened is that you acquired a clearer definition of the outcome desired and
the next action required. What did change is the most important element for
clarity , focus, and peace of mind: how you are engaged with your world.
But what created that? Not “getting or ganized” or “setting priorities.” The
answer is, thinking . Not a lot; just enough to solidify your commitment about
a discrete pressure or opportunity and the resources required dealing with it.
People think a lot, but most of that thinking is of  a problem, project, or
situation
—not about  it. If you actually did this suggested exercise, you were required
to structure your thinking toward an outcome and an action, and that does
not usually happen without a consciously focused ef fort. Reacting is
automatic, but thinking is not.
The Real W ork of Knowledge W ork
The ancestor of every action is a thought.
—Ralph W aldo Emerson
W elcome to the real-life experience of “knowledge work,” and a profound
operational principle: you have to think about your stuf f more than you
realize but not as much as you’re afraid you might. As Peter Drucker wrote:
“In knowledge work . . . the task is not given; it has to be determined. ‘What
are the expected results from this work?’ is . . . the key question in making
knowledge workers productive. And it is a question that demands risky
decisions. There is usually no right answer; there are choices instead. And
results have to be clearly specified, if productivity is to be achieved.” *
Most people have a resistance to initiating the burst of ener gy that it will
take to clarify the real meaning, for them, of something they have let into
their world, and to decide what they need to do about it. W e’re never really
taught that we have to think about our work before we can do it; much of our
daily activity is already defined for us by the undone and unmoved things
staring at us when we come to work, or by the family to be fed, the laundry
to be done, or the children to be dressed at home. Thinking in a concentrated
manner to define desired outcomes and requisite next actions is something
few people feel they have to do (until they have  to). But in truth, it is the
most ef fective means available for making wishes a reality .
Why Things Ar e on Y our Mind
Most often, the reason something is on your mind is that you want it to be
dif ferent than it currently is, and yet:
you haven’ t clarified exactly what the intended outcome is;
This consistent, unpr oductive pr eoccupation with all the things we have to
do is the single  lar gest consumer of time and ener gy .
—Kerry Gleeson
you haven’ t decided what the very next physical action step is; and/or you
haven’ t put reminders of the outcome and the action required in a system
you trust.
That’ s why it’ s on your mind. Until those thoughts have been clarified and
those decisions made, and the resulting data has been stored in a system that
you absolutely  know you will access and think about when you need to, your
brain can’ t give up the job. Y ou can fool everyone else, but you can’ t fool
your own mind. It knows whether or not you’ve come to the conclusions you
need to, and whether you’ve put the resulting outcomes and action reminders
in a place that can be trusted to resurface appropriately within your
conscious mind .*  If you haven’ t done those things, it won’ t quit working
overtime. Even if you’ve already decided on the next step you’ll take to
resolve a problem, your mind can’ t let go until and unless you park a
reminder in a place it knows  you will, without fail, look. It will keep
pressuring you about that untaken next step, usually when you can’ t do
anything about it, which will just add to your stress.
Y our Mind Doesn’t Have a Mind of Its Own
At least a portion of your mind is really kind of stupid, in an interesting way .
If it had any innate intelligence and logic, it would remind you of the things
you needed to do only when you could do something about them.
Do you have a flashlight somewhere with dead batteries in it? When does
your mind tend to remind you that you need more batteries? When you
notice the dead ones! That’ s not very smart. If your mind had any innate
intelligence, it would remind you about those dead batteries only when you
passed new ones in a store. And ones of the right size, to boot.
Rule your mind or it will rule you.
—Horace
Between the time you woke up today and now , did you think of anything
you needed to do that you still haven’ t done? Have you had that thought
more than once? Why? It’ s a waste of time and ener gy to keep thinking
about something that you make no progress on. And it only adds to your
anxiety about what you should be doing and aren’ t.
Most people let their reactive mental process run a lot of the show , especially
where the too-much-to-do syndrome is concerned. Y ou’ve probably given
over a
lot of your “stuf f,” a lot of your open loops, to an entity on your inner
committee that is incapable of dealing with those things ef fectively the way
they are—your mind. Research has now proven that a significant part of
your psyche cannot help but keep track of your open loops, and not (as
originally thought) as an intelligent, positive motivator , but as a detractor
from anything else you need or want to think about, diminishing your
capacity to perform.
The T ransformation of “Stuff”
Here’ s how I define “stuf f”: anything you have allowed into your
psychological or physical world that doesn’ t belong where it is, but for
which you haven’ t yet determined what, exactly , it means to you, with the
desired outcome and the next action step. The reason most or ganizing
systems haven’ t worked for most people is that they haven’ t yet transformed
all the stuf f they’re trying to or ganize. As long as it’ s still stuf f, it’ s not
controllable.
W e need to transform all the “stuf f” we’ve attracted and accumulated into a
clear inventory of meaningful actions, projects, and usable information.
Almost all of the to-do lists I have seen over the years (when people had
them at all!) were merely listings of stuf f, not inventories of the resultant real
work that needed to be done. They were partial reminders of a lot of things
that were unresolved and as yet untranslated into outcomes and actions—that
is, the real outlines and details of what the list maker had to do.
T ypical things you will see on a to-do list: “Mom” “Bank” “Doctor”
“Babysitter” “VP Marketing” etc. Looking at these often creates more stress
than relief, because, though it is a valuable trigger for something that you’ve
committed to do or decide something about, it still calls out psychologically ,
“Decide about me!” And if you do not have the ener gy or focus at the
moment to think and decide, it will simply remind you that you are
overwhelmed.
Stuf f is not inherently a bad thing. Things that command or attract our
attention, by their very nature, usually show up as stuf f. But once we allow
stuf f to come into our lives and work, we have an inherent commitment to
ourselves to define and clarify its meaning. In the professional world, our
jobs require us to think, assess, decide, and execute—minute by minute—
whether about an e-mail
or our notes from the morning’ s strategy meeting. That’ s inherent in your
job. If you didn’ t have to think about those things, you’re probably not
required to. And personally , we will shortchange ourselves when we allow
issues in our daily lifestyle—home, family , health, finances, career , or
relationships—to lie fallow in our consciousness because of lack of
definition of the specific outcomes desired and actions required.
Thought is useful when it motivates action and a hindrance when it
substitutes for action.
—Bill Raeder
At the conclusion of one of my seminars, a senior manager of a major
biotech firm looked back at the to-do list she had come in with and said,
“Boy , that was an amorphous blob of undoability!” That’ s the best
description I have ever heard about what passes for or ganizing lists in most
systems. The vast majority of people have been trying to get or ganized by
rearranging incomplete lists of unclear things; they haven’ t yet realized how
much and what they need to or ganize in order to get the real payof f. They
need to gather everything that requires thinking about and then do  that
thinking if their or ganizational ef forts are to be successful.
The Process: Managing Action
Y ou can train yourself, almost like an athlete, to be faster , more responsive,
more proactive, and more focused in dealing with all the things you need to
deal with. Y ou can think more ef fectively and manage the results with more
ease and control. Y ou can minimize the loose ends across the whole
spectrum of your work life and personal life and get a lot more done with
less ef fort. And you can make front-end decision making about all the stuf f
you collect and create standard operating procedure for living and working
in this millennium.
Before you can achieve any of that, though, you’ll need to get in the habit of
keeping nothing on your mind. And the way to do that , as we’ve seen, is not
by managing time, managing information, or managing priorities. After all:
you don’ t manage five minutes and wind up with six;
you don’ t manage information overload—otherwise you’d walk into a
library and die, or the first time you connected to the W eb, you’d blow up;
and
you don’ t manage priorities—you have  them.
Instead, the key to managing all of your stuf f is managing your actions .
The beginning is half of every action.
—Gr eek pr overb
Managing Action Is the Prime Challenge
What you do with your time, what you do with information, and what you do
with your body and your focus relative to your priorities—those are the real
options to which you must allocate your limited resources. The substantive
issue is how to make appropriate choices about what to do at any point in
time. The real work is to manage our actions.
That may sound obvious. However , it might amaze you to discover how
many next actions for how many projects and commitments remain
undetermined by most people. It’ s extremely dif ficult to manage actions you
haven’ t identified or decided on. Most people have dozens of things that
they need to do to make progress on many fronts, but they don’ t yet know
what they are. And the common complaint that “I don’ t have time to ____”
(fill in the blank) is understandable because many projects seem
overwhelming—and ar e  overwhelming because you can’ t do  a project at all!
Y ou can only do an action related to it. Many actions require only a minute
or two, in the appropriate context, to move a project forward.
Things rarely get stuck because of lack of time. They get stuck because what
“doing” would look like, and where it happens, hasn’ t been decided.
In training and coaching many thousands of people, I have found that lack of
time is not the major issue for them (though they may think it is); the real
problem is a lack of clarity and definition about what a project really is, and
what associated next-action steps are required. Clarifying things on the front
end, when they first appear on the radar , rather than on the back end, after
trouble has developed, allows people to reap the benefits of managing
action.
Getting things done requires two basic components: defining (1) what
“done”
means (outcome) and (2) what “doing” looks like (action). And these are far
from self-evident for most people about most things that have their attention.
The V alue of a Bottom-Up Appr oach
I have discovered over the years the practical value of working on personal
productivity improvement from the bottom up, starting with the most
mundane, ground-floor level of current activity and commitments.
Intellectually , the most appropriate way ought to be to work from the top
down, first uncovering personal and or ganizational purpose and vision, then
defining critical objectives, and finally focusing on the details of
implementation. The trouble is, however , that most people are so embroiled
in commitments on a day-to-day level that their ability to focus successfully
on the lar ger horizon is seriously impaired.
Consequently , a bottom-up approach is usually more ef fective.
Getting current on, and in control of, what’ s in your in-tray and on your
mind right now , and incorporating practices that you can trust will help you
stay  that way , will provide the best means of broadening your horizons. A
creative, buoyant ener gy will be unleashed that will better support your
focus on new heights, and your confidence will increase to handle what that
creativity produces. An immediate sense of freedom, release, and inspiration
naturally comes to people who roll up their sleeves and implement this
process.
V ision is not enough; it must be combined with ventur e. It is not enough to
star e up the steps; we  must step up the stairs.
—Václav Havel
Y ou’ll be better equipped to undertake higher -focused thinking when your
tools for handling the resulting actions for implementation are part of your
ongoing operational style. There are more meaningful things to think about
than your in-tray , but if your management of that level is not as ef ficient as it
could
be, it’ s like trying to swim in baggy clothing.
Many executives I have worked with during the day to clear the decks of
their mundane stuf f have spent the evening having a stream of ideas and
visions about their company and their future lifestyle. This happens as an
automatic consequence of unsticking their workflow .
Horizontal and V ertical Action Management
Y ou need to control commitments, projects, and actions in two ways—
horizontally and vertically . Horizontal control maintains coherence across all
the activities in which you are involved. Imagine your psyche constantly
scanning your environment like a police radar; it may land on any of a
thousand dif ferent items that invite or demand your attention during any
twenty-four -hour period: the drugstore, your daughter ’ s boyfriend, the board
meeting, your aunt Martha, an incoming text message, the strategic plan,
lunch, a wilting plant in the of fice, an upset customer , shoes that need
shining. Y ou need to buy stamps, figure out what to do about the
presentation tomorrow , deposit that check, make the hotel reservation, cancel
a meeting, and watch a movie tonight. Y ou might be surprised at the volume
of things you actually think about and have to deal with just in one day . Y ou
need a good system that can keep track of as many of them as possible,
supply required information about them on demand, and allow you to shift
your focus from one thing to the next quickly and easily .
V ertical control, in contrast, manages thinking, development, and
coordination of individual topics and projects. For example, your inner
“police radar” lands on your next vacation as you and your life partner talk
about it over dinner—where and when you’ll go, what you’ll do, how to
prepare for the trip, and so on. Or you and your boss need to make some
decisions about the new departmental reor ganization you’re about to launch.
Or you just need to get your thinking up-to-date on the customer you’re
about to call. This is “project planning” in the broad sense. It’ s focusing in
on a single endeavor , situation, or person and fleshing out whatever ideas,
details, priorities, and sequences of events may be required for you to handle
it, at least for the moment.
The goal for managing horizontally and vertically is the same: to get things
of f your mind and get them done. Appropriate action management lets you
feel comfortable and in control as you move through your broad spectrum of
work and life, while appropriate project focusing gets you clear about and on
track
with the specifics needed.
The Major Change: Getting It All Out of Y our Head
There is usually an inverse relationship between how much something is on
your mind and how much it’ s getting done.
There is no real way to achieve the kind of relaxed control I’m promising if
you keep things only in your head. As you’ll discover , the individual
behaviors described in this book are things you’re already doing. The big
dif ference between what I do and what others do is that I capture and
or ganize 100 percent of my stuf f in and with objective tools at hand, not in
my mind. And that applies to everything—little or big, personal or
professional, ur gent or not. Everything. *
I’m sure that at some time or other you’ve gotten to a point in a project, or in
your life, where you just had  to sit down and make a list . Subsequently you
felt at least slightly more focused and in control. If so, you have a reference
point for what I’m talking about. Nothing externally changed in your world,
and yet you felt better about it. What did change, significantly , is how you
wer e engaged with  your world . That always happens when you get
potentially meaningful things out of your head. Most people, however , do
that kind of list-making drill only when the confusion gets too unbearable
and they just have  to do something about it.
They usually , though, only make a list about the specific area that’ s bugging
them. But if you made that kind of externalization and review a
characteristic of your ongoing life- and work style, and you maintained it
across all areas of your life (not just the most “ur gent”), you’d be practicing
the kind of mind like water management style I’m describing. In my
experience this process always  improves our perspective and our experience.
Why wait?
There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like
having that thought.
I try to make intuitive choices based on my options, instead of trying to think
about what those options are. I need to have thought about all of that already
and captured the results in a trusted way . I don’ t want to waste time thinking
about
things more than once. That’ s an inef ficient use of creative ener gy and a
source of frustration and stress.
Any “would, could, or should” commitment held only in the psyche creates
irrational and unresolvable pressure, 24-7.
And you can’ t fudge this thinking. Y our mind will keep working on anything
that’ s still in that undecided state. But that kind of recursive spinning in your
mind has now been proven to reduce your capacity to think and perform, and
there’ s a limit to how much unresolved stuf f it can contain before it blows a
fuse.
The short-term-memory part of your mind—the part that tends to hold all of
the incomplete, undecided, and unor ganized stuf f—functions much like
RAM
(random-access memory) on a computer . Y our conscious mind, like the
computer screen, is a focusing tool, not a storage place. Y ou can think about
only two or three things at once. But the incomplete items are still being
stored in the short-term-memory space. And as with RAM, there’ s limited
capacity; there’ s only so much stuf f you can store in there and still have that
part of your brain function at a high level. Most people walk around with
their RAM bursting at the seams. They’re constantly distracted, their focus
disturbed and performance diminished by their own internal mental
overload. Recent research in the cognitive sciences has now validated this
conclusion. Studies have demonstrated that our mental processes are
hampered by the burden put on the mind to keep track of things we’re
committed to finish, without a trusted plan or system in place to handle
them .*
For example, in the past few minutes, has your mind wandered of f into some
area that doesn’ t have anything to do with what you’re reading here?
Probably .
And most likely where your mind went was to some open loop, some
incomplete situation that you have an investment in. That situation merely
reared up out of the RAM part of your brain and yelled at you internally .
And what did you do about it? Unless you wrote it down and put it in a
trusted collection tool that you know you’ll review appropriately sometime
soon, more than likely you worried, or at least reinforced some unresolved
tension, about it. Not the most ef fective behavior: no progress was made,
and stress increased.
A big problem is that your mind keeps reminding you of things when you
can’ t do anything about them. It has no sense of past or future. That means
as soon as you tell yourself that you might need to do something, and store it
only
in your head, there’ s a part of you that thinks you should be doing that
something all the time . Everything you’ve told yourself you ought to do, it
thinks you should be doing right now . Frankly , as soon as you have two
things to do stored only in your mind, you’ve generated personal failure,
because you can’ t do them both at the same time. This produces a pervasive
stress factor whose source can’ t be pinpointed.
It is har d to fight an enemy who has outposts in your head.
—Sally Kempton
Most people have been in some version of this mental stress state so
consistently , for so long, that they don’ t even know they’re in it. Like
gravity , it’ s ever present—so much so that those who experience it usually
aren’ t even aware of the pressure. The only time most of them will realize
how much tension they’ve been under is when they get rid of it and notice
how dif ferent they feel.
It’ s like the constant buzzing noise in a room you didn’ t know was there
until it stops.
Can you get rid of that kind of stress and noise? Y ou bet. The rest of this
book will explain how .
