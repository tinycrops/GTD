Engaging: Making the Best Action Choices
Ultimately and always you must trust your intuition. There are many things
you can do, however , that can enhance that trust.
WHEN IT COMES to your real-time, plow-through, get-it-done workday ,
how do you decide what to do at any given point?
As I’ve said, my simple answer is, trust your heart. Or your spirit. Or , if
you’re aller gic to those kinds of words, try these: your gut, the seat of your
pants, your liver , your intuition—whatever works for you as a reference
point that has you step back and access whatever you consider the source of
your inner wisdom. If you’ve ever made thoughtful versus knee-jerk and
reactive choices, you’ll know what I mean.
That doesn’ t mean you throw your life to the winds—unless, of course, it
does. I actually went down that route myself with a vengeance at one point
in my life, and I can attest that the lessons were valuable, if not necessarily
necessary . *
As outlined in chapter 2 (pages 52 –57) , I have found three priority
frameworks to be enormously helpful in the context of deciding actions: The
four -criteria model for choosing actions in the moment
The threefold model for evaluating daily work
The six-level model for reviewing your own work
These happen to be shown in reverse hierarchical order—that is, the reverse
of the typical strategic top-down perspective. In keeping with the nature of
the Getting Things Done  methodology , I have found it useful to once again
work from the bottom up, meaning I’ll start with the most mundane levels.
The Four -Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment
Remember that you make your action choices based on the following four
criteria, in order:
Context
T ime available
Ener gy available
Priority
Let’ s examine each of these in light of how you can best structure your
systems and behaviors to take advantage of its dynamics.
Context
At any point in time, the first thing to consider is, what could you possibly
do, where you are, with the tools you have? Do you have a phone? Do you
have access to the person you need to talk with face-to-face about three
agenda items?
Are you at the store where you need to buy something? If you can’ t do the
action because you’re not in the appropriate location or don’ t have the
appropriate tools, don’ t worry about it.
As I’ve said, it’ s often helpful to or ganize your action reminders by context
—Calls, At Home, At Computer , Errands, Agenda for Joe, Agenda for Staf f
Meeting, and so on. Since context is the first criterion that comes into play in
your best choice of actions, context-sorted lists prevent unnecessary
reassessments about what to do. If you have a bunch of things to do on one
to-do list, but you actually can’ t do many of them in the same context, you
force yourself to continually keep reconsidering all  of them.
Y ou have fr eedom when you ar e easy in your harness.
—Robert Fr ost
If you have traveled to meet a client at her of fice and on arrival discover that
the meeting will be delayed for fifteen minutes, you will want to refer to
your Calls list for something you could do to use your time productively .
Y our action lists should fold in or out, based on what you could possibly do
at any time.
A second real benefit accrues from or ganizing action reminders by
appropriate context: in itself that forces you to make the all-important
determination about the next physical action on your stuf f. All of my action
lists are set up this way , so I have to decide on the very next physical action
before I can know which list to put an item on. (Is this something that
requires the computer? A phone? Being in a store? T alking in real time with
my wife?) People who give themselves a Miscellaneous action list (i.e. one
not specific in context) often let themselves slide in the next-action decision,
too.
I frequently encourage people I’m working with to structure their list
categories early on as they’re processing their in-trays, because that
automatically grounds their projects in the real things that need to get done
to get them moving.
Cr eative Context Sorting
As you begin to implement this methodology consistently , you will
invariably find inventive ways to tailor your own contextual categories to fit
your situation.
Though sorting by the tool or physical location required is most common,
there are often other uniquely useful ways to filter your reminders.
Before I go on a long trip, I will create “Before T rip” as a temporary
category into which I will move everything from any of my action lists that
must be handled before I leave. That becomes the only list I need to review ,
until they’re all done. At times I have had many next actions that required
me to be in
“creative writing” mode; though those actions were At Computer , they
required a dif ferent time and frame of mind than the rest of the things I
needed to do at my laptop. It was much more relaxing and productive to
manage my focus by sorting those onto a dif ferent, Creative W riting action
list. I currently divide my computer -required actions into those that don’ t
require an Internet connection, those that do, and those that are just surfing
(potentially fun or interesting things on the W eb to explore).
Over the years I have seen people ef fectively use categories such as “Brain
Gone” (for simple actions requiring no mental horsepower) and “Less Than
5-Minute” (for getting quick “wins”). At times people feel more comfortable
sorting their reminders by the areas of focus in their life and work
—“Financial,”
“Family ,” “Administrative,” etc. Recently someone shared with me the value
she found in categorizing actions based upon the immediate emotional
reward for doing them—service to others, life stability , abundance building,
etc. There is no
“right” way to structure your Next Actions lists—only what works best for
you, and that part of your system will likely change as your life does. *
If you are a novice to this process, these details and distinctions may seem
unnecessary or overwhelming. Just keep in mind that when you actually
identify all the next actions you are committed to taking to fulfill your
commitments in life and work, you will likely have many more than a
hundred. T o truly implement an ef fective “external brain” and garner its
amazing results, managing this ground-floor level of your work with this
degree of sophistication will pay of f immeasurably .
T ime A vailable
The second factor in choosing an action is how much time you have before
you have to do something else. If your meeting is starting in ten minutes,
you’ll most likely select a dif ferent action to do right now than you would if
the next couple of hours were clear .
Obviously , it’ s good to know how much time you have at hand (hence the
value of accessible calendar and timepiece). A total-life action-reminder
inventory will give you maximum information about what you need to do,
and make it much easier to match your actions to the windows you have. In
other words, if you have ten minutes before that next meeting, find a ten-
minute thing to do. If your lists have only the big or important things on
them, no item listed may be possible to handle in a ten-minute period—
especially if they are missing next-action reminders. If you’re going to have
to do those shorter action things anyway , the most productive way to get
them done is to utilize the little “weird time” windows that occur throughout
the day .
Additionally there are many times when you have been head down in some
mentally intensive endeavor for a couple of hours, and you’d like to shift
your focus and get some easy wins. Then it’ s great to “snack” on your action
lists for some simple things to complete easily and quickly . Change a
restaurant reservation, call a friend and wish him or her happy birthday ,
order birdseed, or just walk next door to the market or pharmacy for
something on your Errands list.
Energy A vailable
W e all have times when we think mor e effectively , and times when we should
not be thinking at  all.
—Daniel Cohen
Although you can increase your ener gy level at times by changing your
context and redirecting your focus, you can do only so much. The tail end of
a day taken up by a marathon budget-planning session is probably not the
best time to call a prospective client, start drafting a performance-review
policy , or broach a new and sensitive topic with your life partner . It might be
better to call an airline to change a reservation, process some expense
receipts, step out on your patio and watch the sunset, skim a trade journal, or
just clean up a desk drawer .
Just as having all your next-action options available allows you to take
advantage of various time slots, knowing about everything you’re going to
need to process and do at some point will allow you to match productive
activity with your vitality level.
I recommend that you always keep an inventory of things that need to be
done that require very little mental or creative horsepower . When you’re in
one of those low-ener gy states, do those things. Casual reading (magazines,
articles, catalogs, W eb surfing), contact data that needs to be inputted, file
pur ging, backing up your computer , even just watering your plants and
filling your stapler
—these are some of the myriad things that you need or want to deal with
sometime anyway .
There is no reason not to be highly productive, even when you’re not in top
form.
This is one of the best reasons for having very clean edges to your personal
management system: it makes it easy to continue doing productive activity
when you’re not in top form. If you’re in a low-ener gy mode and your
reading material is disor ganized, your receipts are all over the place, your
filing system is chaotic, and your in-tray is dysfunctional, it just seems like
too much work to find and or ganize the tasks at hand, so you simply avoid
doing anything at all and then you feel even worse. One of the best ways to
increase your ener gy is to close
some of your loops. So always be sure to have some easy loops to close,
right at hand .*
These first three criteria for choosing action (context, time, and ener gy)
bespeak the need for a complete next-action reminder system. Much of the
time you won’ t be in a mode to do that kind of coordinated and or ganized
thinking; it needs to have alr eady been done . If it is, you can operate much
more “in your zone” and choose from delineated actions that fit the situation.
Priority
It is impossible to feel good about your choices unless you are clear about
what your work really is.
Given the context you’re in and the time and ener gy you have, the obvious
next criterion for action choice is relative priority: “Out of all my remaining
options, what is the most important thing for me to do?”
“How do I decide my priorities?” is a question I frequently hear from people.
It springs from their experience of having more on their plate to do than they
can comfortably handle. They know that some hard choices have to be made,
and that some things may not get done at all.
At the end of the day , in order to feel good about what you didn’ t get done,
you must have made some conscious decisions about your accountabilities,
goals, and values. That process invariably includes an often-complex
interplay with the goals, values, and directions of the or ganization(s) and
significant people in your life, and with the importance of those relationships
to you. This criterion is addressed by utilizing the six-horizon commitment
model I’ve described and will elaborate on shortly .
The Threefold Model for Evaluating Daily W ork
Setting priorities assumes that some things will be more important than
others, but important relative to what? In this context, the answer is, to your
work—that is, the job(s) you have accepted from yourself and/or from
others. This is where the next two frameworks need to be brought to bear in
your thinking. They’re
about defining your work. Keep in mind that though much of this
methodology will be within the arena of your professional focus, I’m using
“work” in the universal sense, to mean anything you have a commitment to
make happen, personally as well as professionally .
These days, daily work activity itself presents a relatively new type of
challenge to most professionals, something that it’ s helpful to understand as
we endeavor to build the most productive systems. As I explained earlier ,
during the course of the workday , at any point in time, you’ll be engaged in
one of three types of activities:
Doing predefined work
Doing work as it shows up
Defining your work
Y ou may be doing things on your action lists, doing things as they come up,
or processing incoming inputs to determine what work needs to be done with
them, then or later , from your lists.
This is common sense. But many people let themselves get sucked into the
second activity—dealing with unplanned and unexpected things that show
up—
much too easily , and let the other two slide, to their detriment.
It is often easier to get wrapped up in the ur gent demands of the moment
than to deal with your in-tray , e-mail, and the rest of your open loops.
Let’ s say it’ s 10:26 a.m. Monday , and you’re in your of fice. Y ou’ve just
ended a half-hour unexpected phone call with a prospective client. Y ou have
three pages of scribbled notes from the conversation. There’ s a meeting
scheduled with your staf f at eleven, about half an hour from now . Y ou were
out late last night with your spouse’ s parents and are still a little frayed
around the edges (you told your father -in-law you’d get back to him about . .
. what?). Y our assistant just put two arriving international express packages
on your desk, and additionally says he needs to talk with you about three
ur gent meeting requests he doesn’ t know how you want handled. Y ou have a
major strategic-planning session coming up in two days, for which you have
yet to formulate your ideas.
The oil indicator light in your car came on as you drove to work this
morning.
And your boss hinted as you passed her earlier in the hall that she’d like
your
thoughts on the e-mail she sent you last night, before this afternoon’ s three
o’clock meeting.
Are your systems set up to maximally support dealing with this reality , at
10:26 on Monday morning? If you’re still keeping things in your head, and if
you’re still trying to capture only the “critical” stuf f in your lists, I suggest
that the answer is no.
I’ve noticed that people are actually more comfortable dealing with surprises
and crises than they are taking control of processing, or ganizing, reviewing,
and assessing that part of their work that is not  as self-evident. It’ s easy to
get seduced into “busy” and “ur gent” mode, especially when you have a lot
of unprocessed and relatively out-of-control work on your desk, in your e-
mail, and on your mind.
Success is learning to deal with Plan B.
—Unknown
In fact, much of our life and work does just show up in the moment, and it
often becomes the priority when it does. It’ s indeed true for most
professionals (and parents of young children!) that the nature of their job
requires them to be instantly available to handle new work as it appears in
many forms. For instance, you need to pay attention to your boss when he
shows up and wants a few minutes of your time. Y ou get a request from a
senior executive that suddenly takes precedence over anything else you
thought you needed to do today . Y ou find out about a serious problem
fulfilling a major customer ’ s order , and you have to take care of it right
away . Or your baby develops a serious cough.
These are all understandable judgment calls. But the angst begins to mount
when the other actions on your lists are not reviewed and renegotiated by
you or between you and everyone else. The constant sacrifices of not doing
the work you have defined on your lists can be tolerated only if you know
what you’re not doing. That requires regular processing of your in-tray
(defining your work) and consistent review of complete lists of all your
predetermined work.
There are no interruptions—there are only mismanaged inputs.
If choosing to do work that just showed up instead of doing work you
predefined is a conscious choice based on your best call, that’ s playing the
game the most ef fective way you can. Most people, however , have major
improvements to make in how they clarify , manage, and renegotiate their
total inventory of projects and actions. If you let yourself get caught up in
the ur gency of the moment, without feeling comfortable about what you’re
not  dealing with, the result is frustration and anxiety . T oo often the stress and
reduced ef fectiveness are blamed on the surprises. If you know what you’re
doing and what you’re not  doing, surprises are just another opportunity to be
flexible and creative, and to excel.
Another reason people consider unexpected demands or requests negative is
because they don’ t trust their own system and behaviors to be able to put a
“bookmark” on any resulting action that needs to be taken, or on the work
they’re doing at the moment. They know they need do something about the
new work that just showed up, but they don’ t trust that a simple note in their
own in-tray will ensure it is handled with proper timing. So they stop their
previous work and immediately go do what was just requested or required of
them, complaining about the interruption that just disturbed their life. There
are no interruptions, really—there are simply mismanaged occurrences.
In addition, when the in-tray and the action lists get ignored for too long,
random things lying in them tend to surface as emer gencies later on, adding
more unexpected work-as-it-shows-up to fuel the fire.
Many people use the inevitability of an almost infinite stream of
immediately evident things to do as a way to avoid the responsibilities of
defining their work and managing their total inventory . It’ s easy to get lured
into not-quite-so-critical stuf f that is right at hand, especially if your in-tray
and your personal or ganization are out of control. T oo often “managing by
wandering around” is an excuse for getting away from amorphous piles of
stuf f.
This is where the need for the Getting Things Done  methodology really
shows up. Most people did not grow up in a world where defining the edges
of work and managing huge numbers of open loops were required. But when
you’ve developed the skill and habits of processing input rapidly into a
rigorously defined system, it becomes much easier to trust your judgment
calls about the dance of what to do, what to stop doing, and what to do
instead.
The Moment-T o-Moment Balancing Act
At a master level, you can shift like lightning from one foot to the other and
back again. While you’re processing your in-tray , for example, your assistant
enters to tell you about a situation that needs immediate attention. No sweat
—your in-tray and e-mail are still there, with everything still to be processed
in a coordinated view , ready to be picked up again when you can get back to
it. While you’re on hold on the phone, you can be reviewing your action lists
and getting a sense of what you’re going to do when the call is done. When
your infant is crawling around in the living room and you’re highly attuned
to anything unusual you might have to respond to, you can be handling
simple W eb-surfing research on your At Computer list. While you wait for a
meeting to start, you can work down the Read/Review stack you’ve brought
with you. And when the conversation you weren’ t expecting with your boss
shrinks the time you have before your next meeting to twelve minutes, you
can easily find a way to use that window to good advantage.
T o ignor e the unexpected (even if it wer e possible) would be to live without
opportunity ,  spontaneity , and the rich moments of which “life” is made.
—Stephen Covey
Y ou can only do one of these work activities at a time. If you stop to talk to
someone in his or her of fice, you’re not working of f your lists or processing
incoming stuf f. The challenge is to feel confident about what you have
decided to do.
So how do you decide? This again will involve your intuitive judgments—
how important is the unexpected work, against all the rest? How long can
you let your in-tray go unprocessed and all your stuf f unreviewed and trust
that you’re making good decisions about what to do?
Do unexpected work as it shows up, not because it is the path of least
resistance, but because it is the thing you need to do vis-à-vis all the rest.
People often complain about the interruptions that prevent them from doing
their work. But interruptions are unavoidable in life. When you become
elegant at dispatching what’ s coming in and are or ganized enough to take
advantage of
“weird time” windows that show up, you can switch between one task and
the other rapidly . Y ou can be processing e-mails while you’re on hold on a
conference call. Research has now proven that you can’ t actually multitask,
i.e.
put conscious focused attention on more than one thing at a time; and if you
are trying to, it denigrates your performance considerably . If your head is
your only system for placeholding, you will experience an attempted
multitasking internally , which is psychologically impossible and the source
of much stress for many people. If you have established practices for parking
still-incomplete items midstream, however , your focus can shift cleanly from
one to the next and back again, with the precision of a martial artist who
appears to fight four people at once, but who in reality is simply rapidly
shifting attention.
Nonetheless, even if you are a “black belt” in capturing and bookmarking
what’ s going on, you must still learn to make quick and appropriate choices
among those many tasks to keep a healthy balance of your workflow . Y our
choices will still have to be calibrated against your own clarity about the
nature and goals of your work.
Y our ability to deal with surprise is your competitive edge, and a key to
sanity and sustainability in your lifestyle. But at a certain point, if you’re not
catching up and getting things under control, staying busy with only the
work at hand will undermine your ef fectiveness. And ultimately , in order to
know whether you should stop what you’re doing and do something else,
you’ll need to have a good sense of all your roles and how they fit together
in a lar ger context. The only way you can have that is to evaluate your life
and work appropriately at multiple horizons.
The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Y our Own W ork
The six levels of work as we saw in chapter 2 (pages 54 – 56)  may be thought
of in terms of altitude, as in the floors of a building:
Horizon 5: Life
Horizon 4: Long-term visions
Horizon 3: One- to two-year goals
Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability
Horizon 1: Current projects
Ground: Current actions
It makes sense that each of these levels should enhance and align with the
ones above it. In other words, your priorities will sit in a hierarchy from the
top down. Ultimately , if the phone call you’re supposed to make clashes with
your life purpose or values, to be in sync with yourself you won’ t make it. If
your job structure doesn’ t match up with where you need to be a year from
now , you should rethink how you’ve framed your areas of focus and roles, if
you want to get where you’re going most ef ficiently .
Let’ s look at that first example from the bottom up. The phone call you need
to make (action) is about the deal you’re working on (project), which would
increase sales (accountability). This particular deal would give you the
opportunity to move up in the sales force (job goal) because of the new
market your company wants to penetrate (or ganization vision). And that
would get you closer to the way you want to be living, both financially and
professionally (life).
Y our work is to discover your work and then with all your heart to give
yourself to it.
—Buddha
Or , from the other direction, you’ve decided that you want to be your own
boss and unlock some of your unique assets and talents in a particular area
that resonates with you (life). So you create a business for yourself (vision),
with some short-term key operational objectives (job goal). That gives you
some critical roles you need to fulfill to get it rolling (accountability), with
some immediate outcomes to achieve (projects). On each of those projects
you’ll have things you need to do, as soon as you can do them (next actions).
The healthiest approach for relaxed control and inspired productivity is to
manage all the levels in a balanced fashion. At any of those levels, it’ s
critical to identify all the open loops, all the incompletions, and all the
commitments that you have right now , as best you can. They all came,
consciously or not, from the ur ges, pulls, and pushes from these multiple
levels within you. W ithout an acceptance and an objective assessment of
what’ s true in the present, and feeling confident you can manage what
you’ve created, it’ s always dif ficult to cast of f for new shores. What’ s in
your e-mail? What are the projects you need to start or complete with your
kids? What do you need to handle in your current roles at the of fice? What’ s
pushing you to change or attracting you to create in the next months or
years? These are all open loops in your head, though often it takes
deeper and more introspective processes to identify the bigger goals and
subtler inclinations.
The best place to succeed is wher e you ar e with what you have.
—Charles Schwab
There is magic in being in the present in your life. I’m always amazed at the
power of clear observation simply about what’ s going on, what’ s true.
Finding out the exact details of your personal finances, clarifying the
historical data about the company you’re buying, or getting the facts about
who really said what to whom in an interpersonal conflict can be
constructive, if not absolutely necessary and downright healing.
Getting things done, and feeling good about it, means being willing to
recognize, acknowledge, and appropriately engage with all the things within
the ecosystem of your consciousness. Mastering the art of stress-free
productivity requires it.
W orking fr om the Bottom Up
Y ou’re never lacking in opportunities to clarify your priorities at any level.
Pay attention to which horizon is calling you.
In order to create productive alignment in your life, you could quite
reasonably start with a clarification from the top down. Decide why you’re
on the planet.
Figure out what kind of life and work and lifestyle would best allow you to
fulfill that contract. What kind of job and personal relationships would
support that direction? What key things would you need to put in place and
make happen right now , and what could you do physically as soon as
possible to kick-start each of those?
In truth, you can approach your priorities from any level, at any time. I
always have something that I could do constructively to enhance my
awareness and focus on each level. I’m never lacking in more visions to
elaborate, goals to reassess, projects to identify or create, or actions to decide
on. The trick is to learn to pay attention to the ones you need to, at the
appropriate time, to keep
you clear and present with whatever you’re doing.
T rying to manage from the top down when the bottom is out of control may
be the least  ef fective approach.
Because everything will ultimately be driven by the priorities of the level
above it, any formulation of your priorities would obviously most ef ficiently
begin at the top. For example, if you spend time prioritizing your work and
then later discover that it’ s not the work you think you ought to be doing,
you may have wasted time and ener gy that could have been better spent
defining the next job you really want. The problem is that without a sense of
control at the implementation level (current projects and actions), and
without trust in your own ability to manage those levels appropriately , trying
to manage yourself from the top down often creates frustration.
From a practical perspective, I suggest going from the bottom up instead.
I’ve coached people from both directions, and in terms of lasting value, I can
honestly say that getting someone in control of the details of his or her
current physical world, and then elevating the focus from there, has never
missed.
Handle what has your attention and you’ll then discover what r eally  has your
attention.
The primary reason to work from this bottom-up direction is that it clears
your inner decks to begin with, allowing your creative attention to focus on
the more meaningful and elusive visions that you may need to challenge
yourself to identify . Also, this particular method has a high degree of
flexibility and freedom, and it includes a thinking and or ganizing practice
that is universal and ef fective no matter what it’ s focused on. That makes it
worth learning, no matter what the actual content you’re dealing with at the
moment may be. Change your mind and this process will help you adjust
with maximum speed. It takes no time to reset a vision or goal, but learning
to objectify and execute on it in a streamlined, coordinated, and stress-free
way is an art that must be learned and practiced. Knowing you have that
ability will give you permission to play a bigger game. It’ s truly
empowering.
I have learned over the years that the most important thing to deal with is
whatever is most on your mind. The fact that you think it shouldn’ t be on
your
mind is irrelevant. It’ s there, and it’ s there for a reason. “Buy cat food” may
certainly not rank high on some theoretical prioritizing inventory , but if
that’ s what’ s pulling on you the most, in the moment, then handling it in
some way would be Job One. Once you handle what has your attention, it
frees you up to notice what r eally  has your attention. Which, when you
handle that, will allow you to see what r eally  has your attention, and so on.
Almost without exception the executives I have worked with are most
plagued by the management of the nitty-gritty of their workaday world—e-
mails, meetings, travel, projects going of f the rails, etc. When they begin to
get all that under control, their attention invariably turns to areas of focus
and interest from a higher perspective—family , career , and quality-of-life
stuf f. So don’ t worry about what horizon or what content of your life is the
highest priority to deal with—deal with what’ s present.
When you do, you will more ef fectively uncover and address what’ s really
true and meaningful for you. *
While Horizon 5 (purpose and principles) is obviously the most important
context within which to set priorities, experience has shown me that when
we understand and implement all  the levels of work in which we are
engaged, especially the Ground and Horizon 1 levels, we gain greater
freedom and resources to do the bigger work that we’re all about. If your
boat is sinking, you really don’ t care in which direction it’ s pointed!
Although a bottom-up approach is not a conceptual priority , from a practical
perspective it’ s a critical factor in achieving a balanced, productive, and
comfortable life.
Gr ound The first thing to do is make sure your action lists are complete,
which in itself can be quite a task. Those who focus on gathering and
objectifying all of those items discover that there are many (often of some
importance) they’ve for gotten, misplaced, or just not recognized.
Aside from your calendar , if you don’ t have at least fifty next actions and
waiting-fors, including all the agendas for people and meetings, I would be
skeptical about whether you really had all  of them. If you’ve followed
through rigorously with the steps and suggestions in part 2, though, you may
have them already . If not, and you do want to get this level up-to-date, set
aside some time to work through chapters 4 through 6 in real implementation
mode.
When you’ve finished getting this level of control current, you’ll
automatically have a more grounded sense of immediate priorities, which is
almost impossible to achieve otherwise.
Horizon 1 Finalize your Projects list. Does it truly capture all the
commitments you have that will require more than one action to get done?
That will define the boundaries of the kind of week-to- week operational
world you’re in and allow you to relax your thinking for longer intervals.
If you make a complete list of all of the things you want to have happen in
your life and work at this level, you’ll discover that there are actions you
need to do that you didn’ t realize. Just creating this objective inventory will
give you a firmer basis on which to make decisions about what to do when
you have discretionary time. Invariably when people get their Projects list
up-to-date, they discover there are several things that could be done readily
to move things they care about forward.
T aking the inventory of your current work at all levels will automatically
produce greater focus, alignment, and sense of priorities.
V ery few people have this clear data defined and available to themselves in
some objective form. Before any discussion about what should be done this
afternoon can take place, this information must be at hand.
Again, if you’ve been putting into practice the methodology of Getting
Things Done , your Projects list will be where it needs to be. For most of the
people we coach, it takes ten to fifteen hours of capturing, clarifying, and
or ganizing to get to the point of trusting the thoroughness of their inventory .
And to achieve the most pristine level of “mind like water” (nothing on your
mind except what’ s present in the moment), Horizon 1 is the level that seems
to incorporate some of the most interesting challenges. For all of us, there
are situations and circumstances that emer ge that bother , interest, or distract
us, but with which it is not immediately obvious or evident how to engage.
Y our son has a problem with his math teacher; you are frustrated with how
long it takes to implement a procedure in your company; you have a concern
about the person running your fund-raising committee; you keep thinking
you ought to be rekindling your interest in painting; etc. Quieting that subtle
noise requires identifying objective outcomes for each of those (a project),
with accompanying next actions placed into your trusted system. Playing
consistently at this level of the stress-free productivity game is a hallmark of
its mastery .
Horizon 2 This is the level of “current job responsibilities” and “areas of my
life
to maintain at an appropriate standard.” What are the hats you wear , the roles
you play? Professionally , this would relate to your current position and
work.
Personally , it would include the areas of responsibility you’ve taken on in
your family , in your community , and of course with yourself as a functioning
person.
If you’re not totally sure what your job is, it will always feel overwhelming.
Y ou may have some of these roles already defined and written out. If you’ve
recently taken a new position and there’ s an agreement or contract about
your areas of accountability , that would certainly be a good start. If you’ve
done any kind of personal goal-setting and values-clarifying exercises in the
past and still have any materials you created then, add those to the mix.
Next I recommend that you make and keep a list called “Areas of Focus.”
Y ou might like to separate this into “Professional” and “Personal” sublists,
in which case you’ll want to use them both equally for a consistent review .
This is one of the most useful checklists you can create for your own self-
management.
It won’ t require the kind of once-a-week recalibration that the Projects list
will; more likely it will have meaning on a longer recursion cycle.
Depending on the speed of change in some of the more important areas of
your life and work, this should be used as a trigger for potential new projects
every one to three months.
Y ou probably have somewhere between four and seven key areas of
responsibility in your work, and a similar number personally . Y our job may
include things like staf f development, systems design, long-range planning,
administrative support, customer service, and marketing; or accountabilities
for facilities, fulfillment, quality control, asset management, and so on. If
you’re your own business, your attention will be on many more areas than if
you have a very specialized function in a lar ge or ganization. The rest of your
life might entail areas of focus such as parenting, partnering, spiritual
community , health, volunteering, home management, personal finances, self-
development, creative expression, and so forth. And each one of those
specific areas could be broken down into useful subcategories. “Parenting”
could generate separate checklists for each of your children. “Marketing”
can include “Program Design,”
“Research,” “Social Media,” etc.
The operational purpose of the Areas of Focus list is to ensure that you have
all your projects and next actions defined, so you can manage your
responsibilities appropriately . If you were to create an accounting of those
and
evaluate them objectively , in terms of what you’re doing and should be
doing, you’ll undoubtedly uncover projects you need to add to your Projects
list. Y ou may , in reviewing the list, decide that some areas are just fine and
are being taken care of. Then again, you may realize that something has been
bugging or intriguing you in one area and that a project should be created to
deal with it.
“Areas of Focus” is really just a more abstract and refined version of the
T riggers list we covered earlier .
Every person I have worked with in the past thirty years has uncovered at
least two or three important gaps at this level of discussion. For instance, a
common role a manager or executive has is “staf f.” Upon reflection, most
realize they need to add a project or two in that area, such as “Upgrade
support of fice procedures,” “Research hiring a chief of staf f,” or “Upgrade
performance review processes.” Or when objectifying the accountabilities
for aspects of one’ s personal life, often projects like “Research yoga classes”
and “Set up summer activities for the kids” show up.
A discussion of priorities would have to incorporate all of these levels of
current agreements between you and others. If you get this professional “job
description” checklist in play and keep it current, you’ll probably be more
relaxed and in control than most people in our culture. Few people are doing
only what they were hired to do, and keeping clear about new and changing
expectations needs to be a constantly updated conversation. Equally few
people maintain a consistent and objective overview of all the relevant areas
of their balanced life—family , fun, or finances—with a mind to execute on
the gaps.
Driving your thinking and systems from these levels will go a long way
toward moving you from hope to trust as you make the necessary on-the-run
choices about what to do.
When you’re not sure where you’re going or what’ s really important to you,
you’ll never know when enough is enough.
Horizons 3–5 Whereas the three lower levels have mostly to do with the
current state of things—your actions, projects, and areas of responsibility—
from Horizon 3 up the factors of the future and your direction and intentions
are primary . There is still an inventory to take at these plateaus (especially at
the top level, purpose and principles, which represents an ongoing criterion
for monitoring and correcting activities and behaviors), but it’ s more about
“What is
true right now about where I’ve decided I’m going and how I’m going to get
there?” This can range from one-year goals in your job (Horizon 3) to a
three-year vision for your career and personal net worth (Horizon 4) to
intuiting your life purpose and how to maximize its expression (Horizon 5).
I’m blending the three uppermost levels together here because situations
often can’ t easily be pigeonholed into one or another of these categories.
Also, since Getting Things Done  is more about the art of implementation and
execution than about how to define goals and vision, I won’ t of fer a rigorous
examination here. But by its very nature this investigation can broach
potentially deep and complex arenas, which could include business strategy ,
or ganization development, career planning, and life direction and values.
Pick battles big enough to matter , small enough to win.
—Jonathan Kozol
For our purposes, the focus is on capturing what motivators exist for you in
current reality that determine the inventory of what your work actually is,
right now (some of which may be stemming from your higher -level
commitments and intentions). Whether your directions and goals should be
changed or clarified—
based on deeper thinking, analysis, and intuition—could be another
discussion.
Even so, there are probably some things you can identify right now that can
help you get current in your own thinking about your work and what’ s
important in it.
If you were to intuitively frame a picture of what you think you might be
doing twelve to eighteen months from now , or what the nature of your job
will look like at that point, what would that trigger? At this level, which is
subtler , there may be things personally you need to let go of, and people and
systems that may need to be developed to allow the transition. And as the
job itself is a moving tar get, given the shifting sands of the professional
world these days, there may need to be projects defined to ensure viability of
the outputs in your area.
In the personal arena, this is where you would want to consider things like:
“My career is going to stagnate unless I assert my own goals more
specifically to my boss [or my boss’ s boss].” Or “What new things are my
children going to be doing in the next couple of years, and what do I need to
do dif ferently because of that?” Or “What preparation do I need to ensure
that I can deal with this health
problem we’ve just uncovered?”
Through a longer scope you might assess: How is your career going? How is
your personal life moving along? What is your or ganization doing relative to
changes in the environment, and what impact does that have on you? These
are the one-to-five-year -horizon questions that, when I ask them, elicit
dif ferent and important kinds of answers from everyone.
I coached someone in a lar ge international bank who, after a few months of
implementing this methodology and getting control of his day-to-day
inventory of work, decided the time was right to invest in his own start-up
high-tech firm.
The thought had been too intimidating for him to address initially , but
working from the Ground level up made it much more accessible and a
natural consequence of thinking at this horizon. I recently heard of his
phenomenal success in the new endeavor .
If you’re involved in anything that has a future of longer than a year
(marriage, kids, career , a company , an art form, a lifelong passion), you
would do well to think about what you might need to be doing to manage
things along that vector .
Questions to ask are:
What are the longer -term goals and objectives in my or ganization, and what
projects do I need to have in place related to them to fulfill my
responsibilities?
What longer -term goals and objectives have I set for myself, and what
projects do I need to have in place to make them happen?
What other significant things are happening that could af fect my options
about what I’m doing?
Let me emphasize here that setting new goals or raising your standards is not
what I’m specifically advocating. I am, rather , directing your focus to what
may be inherently true about these situations within your current reality . If
they are there in any obvious or subtle way , then addressing them
appropriately will be critical to getting into your own clear space.
Here are some examples of the kinds of issues that show up at this level of
conversation:
The changing natur e of your job, given the shifting priorities of the  company .
Instead of managing the production of your own training
programs in-house, you’re going to outsource them to vendors.
The dir ection in which you feel you need to move in your car eer . Y ou see
yourself doing a dif ferent kind of job a year from now , and you need to make
a transition out of the one you have while exploring the options for a transfer
or promotion.
The or ganization’ s dir ection, given globalization and expansion. Y ou see a
lot of major international travel looming on the horizon for you, and given
your lifestyle preferences, you need to consider how to readjust your career
plans.
Lifestyle pr efer ences and changing needs. As your kids get older , your need
to be at home with them is diminishing, and your interest in investment and
retirement planning is growing.
At the topmost level of thinking you’ll need to ask some of the ultimate
questions: Why does your company exist? Why do you  exist? What is the
core DNA of your existence, personally and/or or ganizationally , that drives
your choices? This is the big-picture stuf f with which hundreds of books and
gurus and models are devoted to helping you grapple.
Why? This is the great question with which we all struggle.
Y ou can have all the other levels of your life and work shipshape, defined,
and or ganized to a T . Still, if you’re the slightest bit of f course in terms of
what at the deepest level you want or are called to be doing, you’re going to
be uncomfortable.
Getting Priority Thinking off Y our Mind
T ake at least a few minutes, if you haven’ t already done so, to jot down some
informal notes about things that occurred to you while you were reading this
chapter . Whatever popped into your mind at these more elevated levels of
your inner radar , write it down and get it out of your head.
Neutral is a state wher e you ar e not jumping ahead too quickly or moving
too slow . Neutral does  not mean being inactive, complacent, or passive. It’ s
about a calm poise that allows for new  information and new possibilities to
emer ge befor e taking further action. When in neutral you  actually incr ease
your sensitivity and intuitive intelligence. Neutral is fertile gr ound for new
possibilities to gr ow fr om.
—Doc Childr e
Then process those notes. Decide whether what you wrote down is
something you really want to move on or not. If not, throw the note away , or
put it on a Someday/Maybe list or in a folder called “Dreams and Goals I
Might Get Around to at Some Point.” Perhaps you want to continue
accumulating more of this kind of future thinking and would like to do the
exercise with more formality—for example, by drafting a new business plan
with your partners, designing and writing out your idea of a dream life with
your spouse, creating a more specific career map for the next three years for
yourself, or just getting a personal coach who can lead you through those
discussions and thought processes. If so, put that outcome on your Projects
list, and decide the next action. Then do it, hand it of f to get done, or put the
action reminder on the appropriate list.
W ith that done, you may want to turn your focus to developmental thinking
about specific projects that have been identified but not fleshed out as fully
as you’d like. Y ou’ll want to ensure that you’re set up for that kind of
vertical processing.
