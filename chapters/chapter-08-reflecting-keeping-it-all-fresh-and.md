Reflecting: Keeping It All Fresh and
Functional
THE PURPOSE OF this whole method of workflow management is not to
let your brain become lax, but rather to enable it to be free to experience
more elegant, productive, and creative activity . In order to earn that freedom,
however , your brain must engage on some consistent basis with all your
commitments and activities. Y ou must be assured that you’re doing what you
need to be doing, and that it’ s OK to be not  doing what you’re not doing.
That facilitates the condition of being  pr esent , which is always the optimal
state from which to operate.
Reviewing your system on a regular basis, reflecting on the contents, and
keeping it current and functional are prerequisites for that kind of clarity and
stability .
If you have a list of calls you must make, for example, the minute that list is
not totally current with all  the calls you need to make, your brain will not
trust the system, and it won’ t get relief from its lower -level mental tasks. It
will have to take back the job of remembering, processing, and reminding,
which, as you should know by now , it doesn’ t do very ef fectively .
All of this means your system cannot be static. In order to support
appropriate action choices, it must be kept up-to-date. And it should trigger
consistent and appropriate evaluation of your life and work at several
horizons.
There are two major issues that need to be handled at this point: What do
you look at in all this, and when?
What do you need to do, and how often, to ensure that all of it works as a
consistent system, freeing you to think and manage at a higher level?
A real review process will lead to enhanced and proactive new thinking in
key areas of your life and work. Such thinking emer ges from both focused
concentration and serendipitous brainstorming, which will be triggered and
galvanized by a consistent personal review of your inventory of actions and
projects.
What to Look At, When
Y our personal system and behaviors need to be established in such a way
that you can see all the action options you need to see, when  you need to see
them.
This is really just common sense, but few people actually have their
processes and their or ganization honed to the point where they are as
functional as they could be.
When you have access to a phone and any discretionary time, you ought to
at least glance at the list of all the phone calls you need to make, and then
either direct yourself to the best one to handle or give yourself permission to
feel OK
about not bothering with any of them. When you’re about to go in for a
discussion with your boss or your partner , take a moment to review the
outstanding agendas you have with him or her , so you’ll know that you’re
using your time most ef fectively . When you need to pick up something at the
dry cleaner , first quickly review all the other errands that you might be able
to do en route.
A few seconds a day is usually all you need for review , as long as you’re
looking at a suf ficient amount of the right things at the right time.
People often ask me, “How much time do you spend looking at your
system?” My answer is simply , “As much time as I need to feel comfortable
about what I’m doing.” In actuality it’ s an accumulation of two seconds here,
three seconds there. What most people don’ t realize is that my lists are in
one sense my of fice. Just as you might have Post-its and stacks of documents
that represent work to do at your workstation, so do I on my Next Actions
lists and calendar . Assuming that you’ve completely collected, processed,
and or ganized your stuf f, you’ll most likely take only a few brief moments
here and there to access your system for day-to-day reminders.
Look at Y our Calendar First . . .
Y our most frequent review will probably be of your daily calendar , and your
daily tickler folder if you’re maintaining one, to see the “hard landscape”
and assess what has to get done. Y ou need to know the time and space
parameters first. Knowing that you have nonstop meetings from eight a.m. to
six p.m., for example, with barely a half-hour break for lunch, will help you
make necessary decisions about any other activities.
. . . Then Y our Action Lists
The maintenance of life and the pursuit of happiness ar e not two separate
issues.
—A yn Rand
After you review all your day- and time-specific commitments and handle
whatever you need to about them, your next most frequent area for review
will be the lists of all the actions you could possibly do in your current
context. If you’re in your of fice, for instance, you’ll look at your lists of
calls, computer actions, and in-of fice things to do. This doesn’ t necessarily
mean you will be doing  anything on those lists; you’ll just evaluate them
against the flow of other work coming at you to ensure that you make the
best choices about what to deal with. Y ou need to feel confident that you’re
not missing anything critical.
Frankly , if your calendar is trustworthy and your action lists are current, they
may be the only things in the system you’ll need to refer to more than every
couple of days. There have been many days when I didn’ t need to look at
any  of my lists, in fact, because it was clear from the front end—my calendar
—what I wouldn’ t be able to do.
The Right Review in the Right Context
Y ou may need to access any one of your lists at any time. When you and
your life partner are decompressing at the end of the day , and you want to be
sure you’ll take care of the “business” the two of you manage together about
home,
family , and/or personal life, you’ll want to look at your accumulated agendas
for him or her . On the other hand, if your boss pops in for a face-to-face
conversation about current realities and priorities, it will be highly functional
for you to have your Projects list up-to-date and your Agenda list for him or
her right at hand. When you suddenly get a text invitation for an unplanned
but highly strategic lunch meeting with a potential client who just showed
up, how fast can you “clear the deck,” print relevant data, and renegotiate
other commitments to be fully present for that engagement, which, if it goes
well, may extend into the afternoon?
Updating Y our System
T o make knowledge pr oductive, we will have to learn to see both for est and
tr ee. W e will have to  learn to connect.
—Peter F . Drucker
The real trick to ensuring the trustworthiness of the whole or ganization
system lies in regularly refreshing your thinking and your system from a
more elevated perspective. That’ s impossible to do, however , if your lists fall
too far behind your reality . Y ou won’ t be able to fool yourself about this: if
your system is out of date, your brain will be forced to fully engage again at
the lower level of remembering.
This is perhaps the biggest challenge of all. Once you’ve tasted what it’ s like
to have a clear head and feel in control of everything that’ s going on, can
you do what you need to do to maintain that as an operational standard? The
many years I’ve spent researching and implementing this methodology with
countless people have proved to me that the magic key to the sustainability
of the process is the W eekly Review .
The Power of the W eekly Review
If you’re like me and most other people, no matter how good your intentions
may be, you’re going to have the world come at you faster than you can keep
up.
Many of us seem to have it in our natures to consistently entangle ourselves
in more than we have the ability to handle. W e book ourselves in back-to-
back meetings all day , go to after -hours events that generate ideas and
commitments we need to deal with, and get embroiled in engagements and
projects that have the potential to spin our creative intelligence into cosmic
orbits.
Y ou will invariably take in more opportunities than your system can process
on a daily basis.
That whirlwind of activity is precisely what makes the W eekly Review so
valuable. It builds in some capturing, reevaluation, and reprocessing time to
keep you in balance. There is simply no way to do this necessary regrouping
while you’re trying to get everyday work done.
The W eekly Review will also sharpen your intuitive focus on your important
projects as you deal with the flood of new input and potential distractions
coming at you the rest of the week. Y ou’re going to have to learn to say no—
faster , and to more things—in order to stay afloat and comfortable. Having
some dedicated time in which to at least get up to the project level of
thinking goes a long way toward making that easier .
What Is the W eekly Review?
V ery simply , the W eekly Review is whatever you need to do to get your head
empty again and get oriented for the next couple of weeks. It’ s going through
the steps of workflow management—capturing, clarifying, or ganizing, and
reviewing all your outstanding commitments, intentions, and inclinations—
until you can honestly say , “I absolutely know right now everything I’m not
doing but could be doing if I decided to.”
From a practical standpoint, here is the three-part drill that can get you there:
get clear , get curr ent , and get cr eative . Getting clear will ensure that all your
collected stuf f is processed. Getting current will ensure that all your
orienting
“maps” or lists are reviewed and up-to-date. The creative part happens to
some degree automatically , as you get clear and current—you will naturally
be generating ideas and perspectives that will be adding value to your
thinking about work and life.
Get Clear
This is the initial stage of gathering up all the loose ends that have been
generated in the course of your busy week. Notes taken in meetings, receipts
and business cards you’ve collected, notices from your kids’ schools, and all
the miscellaneous inputs that, in spite of yourself, have accumulated in all
the weird little pockets and places in your purse, briefcase, smartphone texts,
jacket, and on your dressing-room counter , in addition to what’ s shown up in
your standard input channels like your e-mail in-tray and social media.
Collect Loose Papers and Materials Pull out all miscellaneous pieces of
paper , business cards, receipts, and so on that have crept into the crevices of
your desk, clothing, and accessories. Put it all in your in-tray for processing.
Get “In” to Empty Review any meeting notes and miscellaneous scribbles
on notepaper or in your mobile devices. Decide and list any action items,
projects, waiting-fors, calendar events, and someday/maybes, as appropriate.
File any reference notes and materials. Get the “in” areas of e-mails, texts,
and voice mails to zero. Be ruthless with yourself, processing all notes and
thoughts relative to interactions, projects, new initiatives, and input that have
come your way since your last download, and pur ging those not needed.
Empty Y our Head Put into writing or text (in appropriate categories) any new
projects, action items, waiting-fors, someday/maybes, and so forth that you
haven’ t yet captured and clarified.
Get Curr ent
Y ou need to “pull up the rear guard” now and eliminate outdated reminders
in your system and get your active lists up-to-date and complete. Here are
the steps: Review “Next Actions” Lists Mark of f completed actions. Review
for reminders of further action steps to record. Many times I’ve been moving
so fast I haven’ t had a chance to mark of f many completed items on my list,
much less figure out what to do next. This is the time to do that.
Review Pr evious Calendar Data Review the past two to three weeks of
calendar
entries in detail for remaining or emer gent action items, reference
information, and so on, and transfer that data into the active system. Grab
every “Oh! That reminds me . . . !” with its associated actions. Y ou will
likely notice meetings and events that you attended, which trigger thoughts
of what to do next about the content. Be able to archive your past calendar
with nothing left uncaptured.
Review Upcoming Calendar Look at further calendar entries (long- and
short-term). Capture actions about projects and preparations required for
upcoming events. Y our calendar is one of the best checklists to review
regularly , to prevent last-minute stress and trigger creative front-end
thinking .*  Upcoming travel, conferences, meetings, holidays, etc. should be
assessed for projects to add to your “Projects” and “Next Actions” lists for
any of those situations that are already on your radar but not yet on cruise
control.
Review “W aiting For” List Any needed follow-up? Need to send an e-mail
to get a status on it? Need to add an item to someone’ s Agenda list to update
when you’ll talk with him or her? Record any next actions. Check of f any
already received.
Review “Pr ojects” (and “Lar ger Outcome”) Lists Evaluate the status of
projects, goals, and outcomes, one by one, ensuring that at least one current
kick-start action for each is in your system. Browse through any active and
relevant project plans, support materials, and any other work-in-progress
material to trigger new actions, completions, waiting-fors, etc.
Review Any Relevant Checklists Is there anything else that you haven’ t done,
that you need or want to do, given your various engagements, interests, and
responsibilities?
Get Cr eative
This methodology is not simply about cleaning up and getting closure. Those
are critical factors, to be sure, to utilize for clarity and focus. Ultimately ,
though, the prime driver for my own exploration in this field has been
creating the space to catalyze and access new , creative, and valuable
thinking and direction. T o a great extent, that’ s actually not something you
need to exert a lot of ener gy to achieve, if you have gotten this far in
implementing this methodology . W e are
naturally creative beings, invested in our existence to live, grow , express,
and expand. The challenge is not to be  creative—it’ s to eliminate the barriers
to the natural flow of our creative ener gies. Practically speaking, it’ s about
getting your act together , letting spontaneous ideas emer ge, capturing them,
and utilizing their value. If you, in the process of reading and applying any
of these techniques, have had any kind of “Aha! That reminds me . . .” or
“Hmmm, I think I might want to . . . ,” because you externalized your
thinking and reflected on it, then you’re already demonstrating the
naturalness of this process.
“Point of view” is that quintessentially human solution to information
overload, an intuitive  pr ocess of r educing things to an essential r elevant and
manageable minimum. . . . In a world of  hyperabundant content, point of
view will become the scar cest of r esour ces.
—Paul Saffo
As I said, there may not be anything you need to focus on at this point, since
probably most of your creative thinking will have already shown up and
been integrated in this process. However , there are a couple of additional
triggers that you might find valuable to finish of f this process.
Review “Someday/Maybe” List Check for any projects that may have
become more interesting or valuable to activate, and transfer them to
Projects. Delete any that have simply stayed around much longer than they
should, as the world and your interest have changed enough to take them of f
even this informal radar .
Add any emer ging possibilities that you’ve just started thinking about.
Be Cr eative and Courageous Are there any new , wonderful, harebrained,
creative, thought-provoking, risk-taking ideas you can capture and add into
your system, or “external brain”?
This review process is common sense, but few of us do it as well or
consistently as we could, which means as regularly as we should to keep a
clear mind and a sense of relaxed control. Granted, its scope is daunting,
especially if you haven’ t yet structured and populated your personal system
to have reasonably current and complete data. And even if you have a decent
center of control, given the pressures and demands of your day-to-day world,
seldom is it obvious or easy to make this kind of reflection and recalibration
event happen.
The Right T ime and Place for the Review
The W eekly Review is so critical that it behooves you to establish good
habits, environments, and tools to support it. Once your comfort zone has
been established for the kind of relaxed control that Getting Things Done  is
all about, you won’ t have to worry too much about making yourself do your
review—
you’ll have  to, in order to get back to your personal standards again.
Until then, do whatever you need to, once a week, to trick yourself into
backing away from the daily grind for a couple of hours—not to zone out,
but to rise up at least to the horizon of all your projects and their statuses,
and to catch up with everything else that relates to what’ s pulling on your
attention.
If you have the luxury of an of fice or work space that can be somewhat
isolated from the people and interactions of the day , and if you have
anything resembling a typical five-day workweek, I recommend that you
block out two hours early in the afternoon of your last workday for the
review . Three factors make this an ideal time:
The events of the week are likely to be still fresh enough for you to be able
to do a complete postmortem (“Oh, yeah, I need to make sure I get back to
her about . . .”).
When you (invariably) uncover actions that require reaching people at work,
you’ll still have time to do that before they leave for the weekend.
It’ s great to clear your mental decks so you can go into the weekend ready
for refreshment and recreation, with nothing else pulling on you
unnecessarily .
Y ou may be the kind of person, however , who doesn’ t have normal
weekends. I, for example, often have as much to do on those days as I do
midweek. But I do have the luxury(?) of enduring frequent long plane trips,
which provide an ideal opportunity for me to catch up. Many people have
tailored their own W eekly Review habits to fit with their lifestyles, ranging
from a standard time at their favorite cof feehouse every Saturday morning to
the time on Sunday they sat in the rear of their church during their
daughter ’ s choir practice.
Every now and then go away and have a little r elaxation. T o r emain
constantly at work will  diminish your judgment. Go some distance away ,
because work will be in perspective and a lack
of harmony is mor e r eadily seen.
—Leonar do da V inci
Whatever your lifestyle, you need a weekly regrouping ritual. Y ou likely
have something like this (or close to it) already . If so, leverage the habit by
adding into it a higher -altitude review process.
The people who find it hardest to make time for this review are those who
have constantly on-demand work and home environments, with zero built-in
time or space for regrouping. The most stressed professionals I have met are
the ones who have to be mission-critically reactive at work (e.g., high-level
equities traders and chiefs of staf f) and then go home to a couple of under -
ten-year -old children and a spouse who also had a hard day at work. Some of
them fortunately have a one-hour train commute.
If you recognize yourself in that picture, your greatest challenge will be to
build in a consistent process of regrouping, with your world not directly in
your face. Y ou’ll need to either accept the requirement of an after -hours time
at your desk on a Friday night or establish a relaxed but at-work kind of
location and time at home.
Y our best thoughts about work won’ t happen while you’re at work.
Executive Operational Review T ime I’ve coached many executives to block
out two hours on their calendars at the end of their workweek. For them the
biggest problem is how to balance quality thinking and catch-up time with
the ur gent demands of mission-critical interactions. This is a tough call. The
most senior and savvy of them, however , know the value of sacrificing the
seemingly ur gent for the truly important, and they create their islands of time
for some version of this process. One of our clients, head of executive
development for one of the lar gest companies in the world, suggested that
building in quality time for review and regrouping in order to trust one’ s
intuitive decision making is both critical and sorely lacking in the higher
echelons of his or ganization.
Thinking is the very essence of, and the most difficult thing to do in, business
and in life. Empir e  builders spend hour -after -hour on mental work . . . while
others party . If you’r e not consciously  awar e of putting forth the effort to
exert self-guided integrated thinking . . . then you’r e giving in
to laziness and no longer contr ol your life.
—David Kekich
Even the executives who have integrated a consistent reflective space for
their work, though, often seem to give short shrift to the more mundane
review and catch-up process at the Horizon 1 (Projects) level. Between wall-
to-wall meetings and ambling around your koi pond with a glass of wine at
sunset, there’ s got to be a slightly elevated level of review required for
operational control and focus. If you think you have all your open loops fully
identified, clarified, assessed, and actionalized, you’re probably kidding
yourself.
The “Bigger Picture” Reviews
Y es, at some point you must clarify the lar ger outcomes, the long-term goals,
the visions and principles that ultimately drive, test, and prioritize your
decisions.
What are your key goals and objectives in your work? What should you have
in place a year or three years from now? How is your career going? Is this
the lifestyle that is most fulfilling to you? Are you doing what you really
want or need to do, from a deeper and longer -term perspective?
T rying to create goals before you have confidence that you can keep your
everyday world under control will often undermine your motivation and
ener gy rather than enhance them.
The explicit focus of this book is not teasing out those Horizon 3-to-5 levels.
Ur ging you to operate from a higher perspective is, however , its implicit
purpose
—to assist you in making your total life expression more fulfilling and better
aligned with the bigger game you’re all about. As you increase the speed and
agility with which you clear the Ground and Horizon 1 levels of your life
and work, be sure to revisit the other levels you’re engaged in, as needed, to
maintain a truly clear head.
How often you ought to challenge yourself with that type of wide-ranging
review is something only you can know . The principle I must af firm at this
juncture is this:
Y ou need to assess your life and work at the appropriate horizons, making
the appropriate decisions, at the appropriate intervals, in order to really come
clean. That’ s a lifelong invitation and obligation to yourself, to fulfill
whatever your unfinished destiny or intentionality happens to be.
In or der to understand the world, one has to turn away fr om it on occasion.
—Albert Camus
Over the years I have discovered, through my own experience as well as
being intimately involved with scores of people in their day-to-day worlds,
that getting ultimately grounded and in control of the mundane aspects of
life produces a rich field of natural inspiration about our higher -level stuf f. It
is because of our deeper drives and inclinations that we have embroiled
ourselves in the complexities and commitments that often create confusion
and the sense of being overwhelmed. Y ou felt a profound need to have
children; now you’ve got them, and each one is a major business to manage
for at least two decades.
Y ou’ve felt impelled to be creative and produce recognized (and monetized)
value in the world; so you’ve built a business or committed to a lofty
professional career , and you’re now buried in many more things than you
feel you can handle. More goals may not be necessary for you now—you
need comfort with the ones you’ve already put in motion, and the confidence
that you can execute elegantly on any new ones.
W e can always use a refreshed view of our visions, values, and objectives,
indeed. But in my experience you’ll resist that conversation with yourself if
you don’ t think you’re handling the world you’ve already created for
yourself very well! How long does it take to change a goal or picture of what
you want? Not much time, if any . How long will it take you to feel confident
that you can deliver to yourself the outcomes you commit to? My experience
is that it will be at least two years of implementing and habituating this
methodology to get to that level of self-confidence. That’ s not bad news—
it’ s just news. The good news is that getting more control at the more
mundane and operational levels of your life and work is immediately
available as you start to apply these best practices, and it will likely open up
real aspects of your bigger game that you wouldn’ t be able to recognize or
leverage without it.
The world itself is never overwhelmed or confused—only we are, due to
how we are engaged
with it.
An additional aspect of this future-thinking dynamic is the value of staying
immensely flexible and informal about goal setting. A significant change in
this area has been pioneered in the software world, as “agile programming”
has become the norm for successful start-ups. Have a vision, do your best to
imagine what it might look like, get cranking on producing something as a
viably marketable first iteration, and then “dynamically steer ,” maturing both
your vision as well as how to implement it, based on real feedback from
your real world. The message is: positive future thinking is critical and
fabulous, but it’ s most ef fectively manifested when it is tied to a confidence
of execution in the material world, with responsiveness and course
correction built in.
Which brings us to the ultimate point and challenge of all this personal
capturing, clarifying, or ganizing, and reflecting methodology: It’ s 9:22 a.m.
W ednesday morning—what do you do?
