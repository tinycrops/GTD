Or ganizing: Setting Up the Right Buckets
Airtight or ganization is required for your focus to remain on the broader
horizon and eliminate the constant pressure to remember or be reminded.
HA VING A T OT AL and seamless system of or ganization in place gives
you tremendous power because it allows your mind to let go of lower -level
thinking and graduate to intuitive focusing, undistracted by matters that
haven’ t been dealt with appropriately . But your physical or ganization
system must be better than your mental one in order for that to happen.
Being or ganized means nothing more or less than where something is
matches what it means to you. If you decide you want to keep something as
reference and you put it where your reference material needs to be, that’ s
or ganized. If you think you need a reminder about a call you need to make,
as long as you put that reminder where you want reminders of phone calls
to make, you’re or ganized. As simple as that sounds, it begs a very big
question: What does something mean  to you? It turns out that much of what
people are trying to or ganize has not been clarified, as per the previous
chapter . And even once it has, there are more refined distinctions that are
possible, which will add greater creativity and control for you. I will expand
on some of those in this chapter , as I’ll lead you through the or ganizing
steps and tools that will be required as you process your in-tray . As you
initially process “in,” you’ll create lists and groupings of things you want to
or ganize and you’ll invariably think of additional items to include. In other
words, your or ganization system is not something that you’ll necessarily
create all at once, in a vacuum. It will evolve as you process your stuf f and
test out whether you have put everything in the best place for you . It should
and will evolve, as you do. The core distinctions of what things mean to
you will be true forever , but the best structure for you to
manage them a year from now may look dif ferent than what you come up
with dealing with your world today .
I must Cr eate a System or be enslav’d by another Man’ s.
—W illiam Blake
The outer ring of the W orkflow Diagram (opposite) shows the main
groupings into which things will go as you decide what they are and what
needs to be done about them.
The Basic Categories
There are seven primary types of things that you’ll want to keep track of
and manage from an or ganizational and operational perspective:
A Projects list
Project support material
Calendar actions and information
Next Actions lists
A W aiting For list
Reference material
A Someday/Maybe list
The Importance of Hard Edges
It’ s critical that all of these categories be kept pristinely distinct from one
another . They each represent a discrete type of agreement we make with
ourselves, to be reminded of at a specific time and in a specific way , and if
they lose their edges and begin to blend, much of the value of or ganizing
will be lost.

WORKFLOW DIAGRAM—ORGANIZING
That’ s why capturing and clarifying what your relationship to them is,
specifically , is primary to getting or ganized. Most people try to create more
control in their world by just “getting or ganized,” and they wind up
rearranging incomplete inventories of still unclear things. Once you’ve
gone through my previously suggested processes, however , you will have
very clear contents of what you need to track, and a very practical way to
sort them and create their descriptors.
The categories must be kept visually , physically , and psychologically
separate, to promote clarity .
If you neglect this categorization, and allow things of dif ferent meanings
into the same visual or mental grouping, you will tend to go psychologically
numb to the contents. If you put reference materials in the same pile as
things you still want to read, for example, you’ll go unconscious to the
stack. If you put items on your Next Actions lists that really need to go on
the calendar , because they have to occur on specific days, then you won’ t
trust your calendar and you’ll continually have to reassess your action lists.
If you have projects that you’re not going to be doing anything about for
some time, they must go on your Someday/Maybe list so you can relate to
the Projects list with the rigorous action-generating focus it needs. And if
something you’re W aiting For is included on one of your action lists,
nonproductive rethinking will continually bog you down.
All Y ou Really Need Ar e Lists and Folders
Once you know what you need to keep track of (covered in the previous
chapter ,
“Clarifying”), all you really need are lists and folders—totally suf ficient
tools for reminders, reference, and support materials. Y our lists (which, as
I’ve indicated, could also be items in folders) will keep track of projects and
someday/maybes, as well as the actions you’ll need to take on your active
open loops. Folders (digital or paper based) will be required to hold your
reference material and the support information for active projects.
I would not give a fig for the simplicity on this side of complexity , but I
would give my life for the  simplicity on the other side of complexity .
—Oliver W endell Holmes
Lots of people have been making lists for years but have never found the
procedure to be particularly ef fective. There’ s rampant skepticism about
systems as simple as the one I’m recommending. But most list makers
haven’ t put the appropriate things on  their lists, or have left them
incomplete, which has kept the lists themselves from being very functional
for keeping your head clear . Once you know what goes on the lists,
however , things get much easier; then you just need a way to manage them.
As I’ve said, you shouldn’ t bother to create some external structuring of the
priorities on your lists that you’ll then have to rearrange or rewrite as things
change. Attempting to impose such scaf folding has been a big source of
frustration in many people’ s or ganizing. Y ou’ll be prioritizing more
intuitively as you see the whole list against quite a number of shifting
variables. The list is just a way for you to keep track of the total inventory
of active things to which you have made a commitment, and to have that
inventory available for review .
When I refer to a “list,” keep in mind that I mean nothing more than a
grouping of items with some similar characteristic. A list could look like
one of at least three things: (1) a file folder or container with separate paper
notes for the items within the category; (2) an actual list on a titled piece of
paper (often within a loose-leaf or ganizer or planner); or (3) an inventory of
items on a list in a software program or in a digital mobile device.
Or ganizing Action Reminders
If you’ve emptied your in-tray , you’ll undoubtedly have created a stack of
Pending reminders for yourself, representing longer -than-two-minute
actions that cannot be delegated to someone else. Y ou’ll probably have
anywhere from twenty to sixty or seventy or more such items. Y ou’ll also
have accumulated reminders of things that you’ve handed of f to other
people, and perhaps some things that need to be placed on your calendar or
in a Someday/Maybe holder .
Y ou’ll want to sort all of this into groupings that make sense to you so you
can review them as options for work to do when you have time. Y ou’ll also
want to divide them in the most appropriate way physically to or ganize
those groups, whether as items in folders or on lists, either paper based or
digital.
The Actions That Go on Y our Calendar
For the purposes of or ganization, as I’ve said, there are two basic kinds of
actions: those that must be done on a certain day and/or at a particular time,
and those that just need to be done as soon as you can get to them, around
your other calendar items (some perhaps with a final due date). Calendared
action items can be either time specific (e.g., “10:00–1 1:00 meet with Jim”)
or day specific (“Call Rachel T uesday to see if she got the proposal”).
The calendar should show only the “hard landscape” around which you do
the rest of your actions.
As you were processing your in-tray , you probably came across things that
you put right into your calendar as they showed up. Y ou may have realized
that the next action on getting a medical checkup, for example, was to call
and make the appointment, and so (since the action required two minutes or
less) you actually did it when it occurred to you. W riting the appointment
on your calendar as you made it would then have been common sense.
What many want to do, however , based on perhaps old habits of writing
daily to-do lists, is put actions on the calendar that they think they’d really
like  to get done next Monday , say , but that actually might not, and that
might then have to be moved to following days. Resist this impulse. Y ou
need to trust your calendar as sacred territory , reflecting the exact hard
edges of your day’ s commitments, which should be noticeable at a glance
while you’re on the run. That’ll be much easier if the only things in there
are those that you absolutely have  to get done, or know about, on that day .
When the calendar is relegated to its proper role in or ganizing, the majority
of the actions that you need to do are left in the category of “as soon as
possible, against all the other things I have to do.”
Organizing As-Soon-As-Possible Actions by Context
Over many years I have discovered that the best way to be reminded of an
“as soon as I can” action is by the particular context required for that action
—that is, either the tool or the location or the situation needed to complete
it. For instance, if the action requires a computer , it should go on an At
Computer list. If your action demands that you be out and moving around in
the world (such as stopping by the bank or going to the hardware store), the
Errands list would be the appropriate place to track it. If the next step is to
talk about something face-to-face with your partner , Emily , putting it into
an “Emily” folder or list makes the most sense.
How discrete these categories will need to be will depend on (1) how many
actions you actually have to track; and (2) how often you change the
contexts within which to do them.
If you are that rare person who has only twenty-five next actions, a single
Next Actions list might suf fice. It could include items as diverse as “Buy
nails,”
“T alk to boss about staf f changes,” and “Draft ideas about committee
meeting.”
If, however , you have fifty or a hundred next actions pending, keeping all of
those on one big list would make it too dif ficult to see what you need to see;
each time you got any window of time to do something, you’d have to do
unproductive re-sorting. If you happened to be on a short break at a
conference, during which you might be able to make some calls, you’d have
to identify the calls among a big batch of unrelated items. When you went
out to do odds and ends, you’d probably want to pick out your errands and
make another list.
Another productivity factor that this kind of or ganization supports is
leveraging your ener gy when you’re in a certain mode. When you’re in
“phone mode,” it helps to make a lot of phone calls—just crank down your
Calls list.
When your computer is up and running and you’re cruising along digitally ,
it’ s useful to get as much done online as you can without having to shift into
another kind of activity . It takes more ener gy than most people realize to
unhook out of one set of behaviors and get into another kind of rhythm and
tool set. And obviously , when a key person is sitting in front of you in your
of fice, you’d be wise to have all the things you need to talk about with him
or her immediately at hand.
The Most Common Categories of Action Reminders
Y ou’ll probably find that at least a few of the following common list
headings for next actions will make sense for you:
Calls
At Computer
Errands
At Of fice (miscellaneous)
At Home
Anywhere
Agendas (for people and meetings)
Read/Review
Calls This is the list of all the phone calls you need to make; you can work
of f it as long as you have a phone available. The more mobile you are, the
more useful you’ll find it to have one single list of all your calls: those
strange little windows of time that you wind up with when you’re of f-site,
out and about, traveling, on a break, or waiting for a plane or for your kid to
come out from school of fer a perfect opportunity to make use of that list.
Having a discrete Calls category makes it much easier to focus and
intuitively pick the best one to make in the moment.
I suggest that you take the time to record the phone number alongside each
item. There are many situations in which you would probably make the call
if the number was already there in front of you but not if you had to look it
up, and if you’re using a mobile device then only a tap is required to
engage.
At Computer If you work with a computer—particularly if you move
around with a laptop/tablet or have a computer at work and another at home
—it can be helpful to group all those actions that you need to do when it’ s
on and running.
This will allow you to see all your options for computer work to do,
reminding you of the e-mails you need to send, the documents you need to
draft or edit, and so on.
Think carefully about wher e  and when  and under what cir cumstances  you
can do which actions, and or ganize your lists accordingly .
Because I fly a lot, I maintain an Online action list, separate from my At
Computer one. When I’m on a plane without a W i-Fi service I can’ t connect
to the W eb or my servers, as many actions require. So instead of having to
rethink what I can and can’ t do whenever I look at my At Computer list, I
can trust that
none of my At Computer actions require that I be connected, which frees
my mind to make choices based on other criteria.
If you only do at-computer work at your of fice, or at your home, you could
incorporate those actions on those location-specific lists, though you might
still find it functional to see reminders of computer work grouped together
when you’re sitting in that context. On the other hand, if your work and
activities are primarily mobile-centric, and you could be taking actions
equally on a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, then parking those reminders on
a single Digital context list or folding them into the Anywhere category
might work best.
Errands It makes a lot of sense to group together in one place reminders of
all the things you need to do when you’re out and about. When you know
you need to go somewhere, it’ s great to be able to look at that list to allow
for the option of handling numerous things along the way , in one trip.
Actions like “Get stock certificates from bank deposit box,” “Pick up suit at
the tailor ,” and “Buy flowers for Robyn at the florist” would all go here.
W e must strive to r each that simplicity that lies beyond sophistication.
—John Gar dner
This list could, of course, be nothing more elaborate than a Post-it that you
keep in your planner or on your refrigerator door , or in an Errands category
in some digital task manager .
It’ s often helpful to track sublists within individual Errands items. For
instance, as soon as you realize you need something from the hardware
store, you might want to make “hardware store” the list item and then
append a sublist of all the things you want to pick up there, as you think of
them. On the low-tech end, you could create a “hardware store” Post-it; on
the high-tech side, if you were using a digital list, you could attach a “note”
to “hardware store” on your list and input the details there .*
Simplifying your focus on actions will ensure that more of them get done.
At Office If you work in an of fice, there will be certain things that you can
do
only there, and a list of those things will be useful to have in front of you
then—
though obviously , if you have a phone and a computer in your of fice, and
you have “Calls” and “At Computer” as separate lists, they’ll be in play as
well. I’d use an “Of fice Actions” or “At Of fice” list for anything that
required me being physically present there to take the action, such as
pur ging an of fice filing cabinet or printing and reviewing a lar ge document
with a staf f person.
A major trend now is for or ganizations to become more open, flexible, and
virtual. “Hotel-ing” (i.e. not having a permanent of fice, but rather “plugging
in”
in any available location) is on the rise. Consequently , At Of fice could
mean simply an action that requires being at any of several company
locations. Or , for some people, it’ s useful to have both an At Of fice “A” and
an At Of fice “B” list, for those things that are still discretely tied to one
physical location or another .
At Home Many actions can be done only at home, and it makes sense to
keep a list specific to that context. I’m sure you’ve got numerous personal
and around-the-house projects, and often the next thing to do on them is just
to do them.
“Hang new watercolor print,” “Or ganize travel accessories,” and “Switch
closets to winter clothes” would be typical items for this grouping.
If you have an of fice at home, as I do, anything that can be done only there
goes on the At Home list. (If you work only  at home and don’ t go to another
of fice, you won’ t need an At Of fice list at all—the At Home list could
suf fice.) Similar to people who work at various locations, many people have
multiple personal work environments, such as vacation homes, boats, and
even the local gourmet cof fee shop or café. “At Starbucks” can be a fine
categorization for an action list!
Agenda s*  Invariably you’ll find that many of your next actions need to
either occur in a real-time interaction with someone or be brought up in a
committee, team, or staf f meeting. Y ou have to talk to your partner about an
idea for next year; you want to check with your life partner about his
schedule for the spring; you need to delegate a task to your assistant that’ s
too complicated to explain in an e-mail. And you must make an
announcement at the Monday staf f meeting about the change in expense-
report policies.
Standing meetings and people you deal with on an ongoing basis often need
their own Agenda list.
These next actions should be put on separate Agenda lists for each of those
people and for that meeting (assuming you attend it regularly).
Professionals who keep a file folder to hold all the things they need to go
over with their boss already use a version of this method. If you’re
conscientious about determining all your next actions, though, you may find
that you’ll need somewhere between three and fifteen of these kinds of lists.
I recommend that separate lists be kept for bosses, partners, assistants, and
children. Y ou should also keep the same kind of list for your attorney ,
financial adviser , accountant, and/or computer consultant, as well as for
anyone else with whom you might have more than one thing to go over the
next time you talk on the phone or in person.
The broader your responsibilities, and the more senior your or ganizational
roles, the more you will get things done through your communications and
transactions with other people.
If you participate in standing meetings—staf f meetings, project meetings,
board meetings, committee meetings, parent/teacher meetings, whatever—
they , too, deserve their own lists, in which you collect things that will need
to be addressed on those occasions.
Often you’ll want to keep a running list of things to go over with someone
you’ll be interacting with only for a limited period of time. For instance, if
you have a contractor doing a significant piece of work on your house or
property , you can create a list for him for the duration of the project. As
you’re walking around the site after he’ s left for the day , you may notice
several things you need to talk with him about, and you’ll want that list to
be easy to capture and to access as needed.
Given the usefulness of this type of list, your system should allow you to
add Agendas ad hoc, as needed quickly and simply . For example, inserting
a page or a list for a person or a meeting within an Agenda section of a
loose-leaf notebook planner takes only seconds, as does adding a dedicated
“note” within an Agenda category in your digital tools.
Read/Review Y ou will no doubt have discovered in your in-tray a number of
things for which your next action is to read. I hope you have held to the
two-minute rule and dispatched many of those quick-skim items already—
tossing, filing, or routing them forward as appropriate.
Those who make the worst use of their time ar e the first to complain of its
shortness.
—Jean de La Bruyèr e
T o-read printed items that you know will demand more than two minutes of
your time are usually best managed in a separate physical stack tray labeled
“Read/Review .” This is still a “list” by my definition, but one that’ s more
ef ficiently dealt with by grouping the documents and magazines themselves
in a tray and/or portable folder .
For many people, the Read/Review stack can get quite lar ge. That’ s why it’ s
critical that the pile be reserved only for those longer -than-two-minute
things that you actually want to read when you have time. That can be
daunting enough in itself, but things get seriously out of control and
psychologically numbing when the edges of this category are not clearly
defined. A pristine delineation will at least make you conscious of the
inventory , and if you’re like most people, having some type of self-
regulating mechanism will help you become more aware of what you want
to keep and what you should just get rid of.
Some professionals (e.g., attorneys) still work with significant printed
materials, and although most of their documents may be generated and
maintained in digital form, working with the document in physical form
still remains the optimal way to deal with it. In those cases it often makes
sense, in addition to a Read/Review box or tray , to have a Review/Respond
category for the more rigorous reading that requires a dif ferent kind of
focus.
It’ s practical to have or ganized reading material at hand when you’re on
your way to a meeting that may be starting late, a seminar that may have a
window of time when nothing is going on, a dentist appointment that may
keep you waiting, or , of course, if you’re going to have some time on a train
or plane. Those are all great opportunities to browse and work through that
kind of reading. People who don’ t have their Read/Review material
or ganized can waste a lot of time, since life is full of weird little windows
when it could be used.
Given the amount of digital input we’re getting that includes data to read
and view , much of which is not really critical to our work or life but is
potentially interesting or fun, it can be useful to create an or ganizational
bucket within that world for such things. A Review/W atch file in your e-
mail folder system or a Surf W eb action list could be a good place to hold e-
mails with links to recommended videos, blogs, or online articles.
Organizing “W aiting For”
Manage the commitments of others before their avoidance creates a crisis.
Like reminders of the actions you need to do, reminders of all the things
that you’re waiting to get back from or get done by others have to be sorted
and grouped. Y ou won’ t necessarily be tracking discrete action steps here,
but more often final deliverables or projects that others are responsible for ,
such as the tickets you’ve ordered from the theater , the scanner that’ s
coming for the of fice, the OK on the proposal from your client, and so on.
When the next action on something is up to someone else, you don’ t need
an action  reminder , just a trigger about what you’re waiting for and from
whom. Y our role is to review that list as often as you need to and assess
whether you ought to be taking an action, such as checking the status or
lighting a fire in some way under the project.
For many people, especially those in managerial or supervisory positions,
getting this inventory of unfulfilled commitments that we care about from
others captured, current, complete, and reviewed creates tremendous relief
and improved focus going forward.
Y ou’ll probably find that it works best to keep this W aiting For list close at
hand, in the same system as your Next Actions reminder lists. The
responsibility for the next step may bounce back and forth many times
before a project is finished. For example, you may need to make a call to a
vendor to request a proposal (which then goes to your W aiting For list).
When the proposal comes in, you have to review it (it lands in your
Read/Review tray or on your At Computer list). Once you’ve gone over it,
you send it to your boss for her approval (now it’ s back on your W aiting For
list). And so on. *
It’ s also very useful to have your W aiting For list available when you are
meeting with or talking to anyone who might be responsible for any of
those deliverables. It is much more elegant to broach a conversation early
on, such as
“Oh yeah, how’ s it going with the Gonzalez proposal?” than to wait until
it’ s overdue and the situation is in a stress mode.
It’ s important for this category in particular to include the date that each
item is requested for each entry , as well as any agreed-upon due date.
Follow-up is much more meaningful when you can say , “But I placed the
order March twentieth” or “Y ou’ve had the proposal now for three weeks.”
In my experience,
just this one tactical detail is worth its weight in gold.
Y ou’ll get a great feeling when you know that your W aiting For list is the
complete inventory of everything you care about that other people are
supposed to be doing.
Using the Original Item as Its Own Action Reminder
Keep actionable e-mails and paper separated from all the rest.
The most ef ficient way to track your action reminders is to add them to lists
or folders as they occur to you. The originating trigger won’ t be needed
after you have processed it. Y ou might take notes in the meeting with your
boss, but you can toss those after you’ve pulled out any projects and actions
associated with them. While some people try to archive texts or voice mails
that they still need to do something about, that’ s not the most ef fective way
to manage the reminders embedded in them.
There are some exceptions to this rule, however . Certain kinds of input will
most ef ficiently serve as their own reminders of required actions, rather
than your having to write something about them on a list. This is
particularly true for some paper -based materials and some e-mail.
Managing Paper -Based W orkflow
Some things are their own best reminders of work to be done. The category
of Read/Review articles, publications, and documents is a good example. It
would obviously be overkill to write “Review V ogue  magazine” on some
action list when you could just as easily toss the magazine itself into your
Read/Review tray to act as the trigger .
Another example: if you are still doing paper -based bill paying, you’ll
probably find it easier to deal with the bills by paying them all at one time,
so you keep them in a folder or stack tray labeled “Bills to Pay” (or , more
generically , “Financial to Process”). Similarly , receipts for expense
reporting should be either dealt with at the time they’re generated or kept in
their own Receipts to Process envelope or folder . *
The specific nature of your work, your input, and your workstation may
make it more ef ficient to or ganize other categories using only the original
document itself. A customer -service professional, for instance, may deal
with numerous requests that show up in some standard form, and in that
case maintaining a tray or file (paper or digital) containing only those
actionable items is the best way to manage them. An attorney or accountant
may deal with documents they need to spend time reviewing to determine
actions, which could be stacked in a tray on the desk with items of that
specific nature.
The primary reason for or ganizing is to reduce cognitive load—i.e. to
eliminate the need to constantly be thinking, “What do I need to do about
this?”
Whether it makes more sense to write reminders on a list or to use the
originating documents in a tray or folder or digital directory will depend to
a great extent on logistics. Could you use those reminders somewhere other
than at your desk? If so, the portability of the material should be considered.
If you couldn’ t possibly do that work anywhere but at your desk, then
managing reminders of it solely at your workstation is the better choice.
Whichever option you select, the reminders should be in visibly discrete
categories based upon the next action required. If the next action on a
service order is to make a call, it should be in a Calls group; if the action
step is to review information and input it into the computer , it should be
labeled “At Computer .” Most undermining of the ef fectiveness of many
workflow systems I see is the fact that all the documents of one type (e.g.
service requests) are kept in a single tray or file, even though dif ferent kinds
of actions may be required on each one. One request needs a phone call,
another needs data reviewed, and still another is waiting for someone to get
back with some information—but they’re all sorted together . This
arrangement can cause a person’ s mind to go numb to the stack because of
all the decisions that are still pending about the next-action level of doing.
My personal system is highly portable, with almost everything kept on lists,
but I still maintain a Read/Review stack tray in my of fice and the traveling
version as a plastic folder with the same title. Though I store and read some
magazines digitally , it’ s still both logistically functional and aesthetically
pleasing to me to have the physical version at hand.
Managing E-mail-Based W orkflow
Like some paper -based materials, e-mails that need action are sometimes
best as their own reminders—in this case within the e-mail system itself.
This is especially true if you get a lot of e-mail and spend a lot of your work
time with your e-mail software active at hand. E-mails that you need to act
on may then be stored within the system instead of having their embedded
actions written out or distributed on another list.
Many people have found it helpful to set up two or three unique folders on
their e-mail navigator bars. T rue, most folders in e-mail should be used for
reference or archived materials, but it’ s also possible to set up a workable
system that will keep your actionable messages discretely or ganized outside
the “in”
area itself (which is where most people tend to keep them) .*
If you choose this route, I recommend that you create one folder for any
longer -than-two-minute e-mails that you need to act on (again, you should
be able to dispatch many messages right of f the bat by following the two-
minute rule). The folder name should begin with a prefix letter or symbol so
that (1) it looks dif ferent from your reference folders and (2) it sits at the
top of your folders in the navigator bar . Use something like the @ sign or
the hyphen, whichever will sort into your system at the top. Y our resulting
@ACTION folder will hold those e-mails that you need to do something
about.
Next you can create a folder titled “@W AITING FOR,” which will show up
in the same place as the @ACTION folder . Then, as you receive e-mails
that indicate that someone is going to do something you care about tracking,
you can drag them over into the @W AITING FOR file. It can also hold
reminders for anything that you delegate via e-mail: when you forward
something, or use e-mail to make a request or delegate an action, just save a
cc: or bcc: copy into your @W AITING FOR file. *
It takes much less ener gy to maintain e-mail backlog at zero than at a
thousand.
Some applications allow you to file a copy of an e-mail into one of your
folders as you send it (with a “Send and File” button). Others will
simultaneously save only into your universal “Sent Mail” folder . In the
latter case, what seems to work best for many is to copy (“cc” or “bcc”)
themselves when they delegate via e-mail, and then to put that copy into
their “@W AITING
FOR” folder .
Getting E-mail “In” to Empty The method detailed above will enable you
to actually get everything out of your e-mail in-tray , which will be a huge
boon to your clarity about, and control of, your day-to-day work. Y ou’ll
reclaim “in” as
“in,” so anything residing there will be like a new message in your voice
mail or an unread text on your mobile device—clues that you need to
process something. Most people use their e-mail “in” for staging still-
undecided actionable things, reference, and even trash, a practice that
rapidly numbs the mind: they know they’ve got to reassess everything every
time they glance at the screen.
Again, getting “in” empty doesn’ t mean you’ve handled everything. It
means that you’ve deleted  what you could, filed what you wanted to keep
but don’ t need to act on, done  the less-than-two-minute responses, and
moved into your reminder folders all the things you’re waiting for and all
your actionable e-mails.
Now  you can open the @ACTION file and review the e-mails that you’ve
determined you need to spend time on. Isn’ t that process easier to relate to
than fumbling through multiple screens, fearing all the while that you may
miss something that’ll blow up on you?
A Caution About Dispersing Reminders of Y our Actions
Paper -based data is sometimes easier to trust for utility than digital versions.
There’ s an obvious danger in putting reminders of things you need to do
somewhere out of sight. The function of an or ganization system is primarily
to supply the reminders you need to see when you need to see them, so you
can trust your choices about what you’re doing (and what you’re not doing).
Before you leave your of fice for the day , or before you decide to spend a big
part of your day doing something previously unplanned, those actionable e-
mails that you still have pending must be reviewed individually , just like
your Calls and At Computer lists. In essence, @ACTION is an extension of
your At Computer list and should be handled in exactly the same fashion.
Y our paper -based Pending workflow must likewise be assessed like a list if
the paper materials are being used as your only reminders.
Distributing action triggers in a folder , on lists, and/or in an e-mail system is
perfectly OK, as long as you r eview all of the categories to which you’ve
entrusted your triggers equally , as r equir ed . Y ou don’ t want things lurking
in the recesses of your systems and not being used for their intended
purpose: reminding you. The digital world can be dangerous in this regard,
because as soon as data is of fscreen, it can tend to disappear as a viable
prompt. This has caused many computer -savvy people to revert to a paper
planner—its physicality and visual obviousness can create much more trust
that their reminders will actually remind them!
In order to hang out with friends or take a long, aimless walk and truly have
nothing on your mind, you’ve got to know where all your actionable items
are located, what they are, and that they will wait. And you need to be able
to do that in a few seconds, not days.
Or ganizing Project Reminders
Creating and maintaining one list of all your projects (that is, again, every
commitment or desired outcome that may require more than one action step
to complete) can be a profound experience! Y ou probably have more of them
than you think. If you haven’ t done so already , I recommend that initially
you make a Projects list in a very simple format, similar to the ones you’ve
used for your lists of actions; it can be a category in a digital or ganizer , a
page in a loose-leaf planner , or even a single file folder labeled “Projects,”
with either a master list or separate sheets of paper for each one.
The Pr ojects List(s)
A complete and current Projects list is the major operational tool for moving
from tree-hugging to forest management.
The Projects list is not meant to hold plans or details about your projects
themselves, nor should you try to keep it arranged by priority or size or
ur gency
—it’ s just a comprehensive index of your open loops. Y ou actually won’ t be
working of f of the Projects list during your moment-to-moment activities;
for the most part, your calendar , action lists, and any unexpected tasks that
come up will constitute your tactical and immediate focus. Remember , you
can’ t do  a project; you can only do the action steps it requires. Being aware
of the horizon represented by your projects, however , is critical for
extending your comfort with your control and focus into longer reaches of
time.
The real value of the Projects list lies in the complete review it can provide
(at least once a week), ensuring that you have action steps defined for all of
your projects and that nothing is slipping through the cracks. A quick glance
at this list from time to time will enhance your underlying sense of control.
Y ou’ll also know that you have an inventory available to you (and to others)
whenever it seems advisable to evaluate workload(s).
The V alue of a Complete Pr ojects List
The very broad and simple definition of a project that I have given (more
than one action needed to achieve a desired result) provides an important net
to capture the more subtle things that pull or push on your consciousness. If
you work in an industry that is formally project focused (manufacturing,
software, consulting, etc.), it may be challenging to realize that “look into
getting a dog for our kids” and “find a good tailor” are projects! But whether
you call them
“projects” or something else, they still demand a certain kind of attention to
relieve their pressure on your internal space.
Getting the inventory of all of those things complete, current, and clear for
yourself, and acquiring the habit of maintaining it that way , could be one of
the most valuable things you do to enable stress-free productivity for
yourself from now on. Here are some of the reasons why:
Critical for control and focus
Alleviates subtle tensions
Core of the W eekly Review
Facilitates relationship management
Critical for Contr ol and Focus It is impossible to be truly relaxed and in
your productive state when things you’ve told yourself you need to handle
continue to pull at your mind—whether they be little or big. It seems that
“I’ve got to get my driver ’ s license renewed” can take up as much space in
your head as “I need to
formulate the agenda for next year ’ s conference” when an external list of
such things is not complete and reviewed regularly .
Projects seldom show up in nice, neat packages. Small things often slip
unexpectedly into bigger things.
Alleviates Subtle T ensions The smaller or more subtle things we tell
ourselves we need to deal with create some of the more challenging stresses
to handle, simply because they are not so much “in your face.” Projects often
don’ t show up in nice, neat packages. They start as what seems a simple
situation, communication, or activity , but they slowly morph into something
bigger than you expected. Y ou thought you handled getting your daughter
into preschool, but now there’ s a problem with the registration forms or a
change in the logistical details. Y ou thought the invoice you sent was
complete and accurate, but now the client says he didn’ t agree to something
you billed him for . Getting these kinds of situations identified and into your
system with desired outcomes for appropriate engagement creates a wealth
of fresh ener gy with unexpected positive results.
Cor e of the W eekly Review As I have indicated in other places, the W eekly
Review is the critical success factor for marrying your lar ger commitments
to your day-to-day activities. And a complete Projects list remains the
linchpin for that orientation. Ensuring weekly that you’re OK about what
you’re doing (or not doing) with a dog for your kids, along with what you’re
doing (or not doing) about next year ’ s conference, is an essential practice.
But that Projects list must already be there, in at least a somewhat recent
form, before you have the capability to think about things from that
perspective.
Facilitates Relationship Management Whether you are in conversation with
your boss, your staf f, your partner , or your family , having a sense of control
and overview of all of your commitments that may have relevance in your
relationships with them is extremely valuable. Invariably there are
challenges with allocating limited resources—your time, your money , your
attention. And when others are involved with you in ways that pull on those
resources, being able to negotiate (and frequently r e  negotiate) those explicit
and implicit agreements is the only way to ef fectively relieve those inherent
pressures. Once
executives and spouses and staf f people get the picture of the commitments
of their work and life, it triggers extremely important and constructive
conversations with those involved. But it doesn’ t happen without that
complete list.
Wher e to Look for Pr ojects Still to Uncover
There are three primary areas in which you are likely to have “hidden”
projects: Current activities
Higher -horizon interests and commitments
Current problems, issues, and opportunities
Curr ent Activities Often there are projects that need to be captured from a
simple inventory of your calendar , your action lists, and your workspaces.
What meetings are on your schedule—past or upcoming—because of some
outcome you’re committed to achieving that the meeting itself does not
complete or resolve? Y ou may notice that a conference call you’ve been
scheduled for is about a client request for a new custom program he or she
might want. V oila! A project—“Look into possible custom program for
Client XYZ.” Y ou may have an evening orientation event calendared for
parents at your son’ s school that reminds you that you have an issue to
resolve about his schedule of classes.
Personal or business trips coming up, conferences on your calendar , etc.—all
should be assessed for projects that deserve acknowledging.
There are also very likely still unrecognized projects connected to the next
actions on your lists. Many times people we work with have “Call Mario re:
the fund-raising event” on their Calls list, but have not yet identified
“Finalize the fund-raiser” as something that should be on their Projects list.
And—though it should be obvious but at times isn’ t—there are proposals or
contracts to review in your briefcase, forms to fill out for the bank on your
desk at home, or a broken watch in your purse that are actually project
artifacts.
Double-check that you have them all associated with the further and final
outcomes instead of remaining workflow orphans.
Higher -Horizon Inter ests and Commitments There is a good chance that you
might still have subtle attention on some of your commitments and interests
from a longer and higher view of your responsibilities, goals, visions, and
core
values.
A review of the accountabilities you’re invested in professionally—the
things you need to be doing well in your roles at work—and the areas of
your life you need to keep up to certain standards will likely trigger some
reminders of things that may have been taking some of your attention, for
which defining a project about them will be valuable.
If you have professional goals, company objectives, and strategic plans, have
you identified all the projects that they should engender for you, so that you
can move on them appropriately? I have seldom had an executive pull out
and review any long-range planning document without her realizing there is
at least one project she needs to clarify for herself in regard to it. Are there
things coming toward you further out in the future of your personal life that
have started to pull on your attention to do something about them—kids or
parents growing older , your retirement, life partner ’ s aspirations, fun and
creative things you’d love to start exploring? This kind of reflection often
produces at least some “look into” kinds of projects that, once identified,
will produce a greater sense of being on top of your bigger world.
Curr ent Pr oblems, Issues, and Opportunities A very rich place from which
to gather items for your inventory is the broad area of often-amorphous
things that can disturb your focus if not recognized and dealt with by
shaping them into real projects with action steps. These fall into three
categories:
Problems
Process improvements
Creative and capacity-building opportunities
When is a problem a project? Always. When you assess something as a
problem instead of as something to simply be accepted as the way things are,
you are assuming there is a potential resolution. Whether there is or not
might still need to be determined. But at the very least you have some
research to do to find out. “Look into improving Frederick’ s relationship
with his school,”
“Resolve situation with landlord and building maintenance,” and “Get
closure on compensation dispute with business partner” are the kinds of very
real projects that you might resist defining as such. When you actually do
put words to it, put it on your list and create a next action for it; you will
surprise yourself with a new level of elegance in the stress-free productivity
game.
Invariably there are also projects lurking amid your administrative,
maintenance, and workflow processes—in both the professional and
personal arenas. What do you find yourself complaining about regarding
your systems or simply how things are getting done (or not)? Is there
anything frustrating about your procedures for filing, storage,
communication, hiring, tracking, or record keeping? Does anything need
improving in terms of your personal or business expense reporting, banking
or investing processes, or how you keep in touch with friends and family?
These are also the kinds of projects that usually become projects slyly—it’ s
tricky to notice when they cross the line between mildly irritating and a real
bother (or inspiration) that deserves to get done.
Finally , there might very well be things you’ve been telling yourself you’d
like to learn or experience to expand your own development or creative
expression. W ould you like to learn Italian cooking or how to draw? Have
you been telling yourself it would be great to take an online course in digital
photography or social media marketing? It’ s very possible that many of these
kinds of “might like to” projects would live just fine on your
Someday/Maybe list. But as you gain greater familiarity with the
ef fectiveness of GTD, you will want to take advantage of the methodology
to more readily incorporate new , interesting, and useful experiences into
your life by defining desired outcomes about them on the Projects list.
One List, or Subdivided?
Most people find that one list is the best way to go because it serves as a
master inventory rather than as a daily prioritizing guideline. The or ganizing
system merely provides placeholders for all your open loops and options so
your mind can more easily make the necessary intuitive, moment-to-moment
strategic decisions.
Frankly , it doesn’ t matter how many dif ferent lists of projects you have, so
long as you look at the contents of all  of them as often as you need to. For
the most part you’ll do that in one fell swoop during your W eekly Review .
Some Common W ays to Subsort Pr ojects
There are some situations in which it makes good sense (and eases some
anxieties!) to subsort a Projects list. Let’ s look at some usual options.
Personal/Pr ofessional Many people feel more comfortable seeing their lists
divided up between personal and professional projects. If you’re among
them, be advised that your Personal list will need to be reviewed as
judiciously as your Professional one, and not just saved for weekends. Many
actions on personal things will need to be handled on weekdays, exactly like
everything else. And often some of the greatest pressures on professionals
stem from the personal aspects of their lives that they are letting slip.
Delegated Pr ojects If you’re a senior manager or executive, you probably
have several projects that you are directly responsible for but have handed
of f to people who report to you. While you could, of course, put them on
your W aiting For list, it might make better sense to create a “Projects—
Delegated” list to track them. Y our task will be simply to review the list
regularly enough to ensure that everything on it is moving along
appropriately .
Specific T ypes of Pr ojects
The right amount of complexity is whatever creates optimal simplicity .
Some people have as part of their work and lifestyle several dif ferent
projects of the same type, which in some instances it may be valuable to
group together as a sub-list of Projects. For example, a corporate trainer or a
keynote speaker might maintain a separate category of “Projects—
Presentations,” with a chronological listing of all the upcoming events of
that nature. These would be “projects” like the rest, in that they need to be
reviewed for actions until they are completed; but it might be helpful to see
them all or ganized on one list, in the order they are coming up on the
calendar , apart from the other projects.
If you are a real estate agent, sell consulting services, or develop proposals
for a relatively small number of prospective clients in any profession, you
will likely find it useful to see all of your outstanding “sales relationships in
progress” in one view . This could be a separate list in a planner or digital
application, but to be optimally functional it would need to be complete and
each item regularly reviewed for current actions.
Some people like to sort their projects by major areas of focus—parents
tracking those about their children, an entrepreneur dividing projects by the
various roles he’ s fulfilling (Finance, Sales, Operations), and the like.
Again, how you decide to group your projects is not nearly as critical as
ensuring that your inventory is complete, current, and assessed suf ficiently
to get it of f your mind. No matter how you or ganize it now , you will very
likely change your structure as you get more experience using your system
and as the nature of your focus shifts in work and life.
What About Subpr ojects?
Some of your projects will likely have major subprojects, each of which
could in theory be seen as a whole project. If you’re moving into a new
residence, for instance, and are upgrading or changing much of what’ s there,
you may have a list of actionable items like “Finalize the patio,” “Upgrade
the kitchen,” “Set up home of fice space,” and so on, all of which could in
themselves be considered separate projects. Do you make all of this one
entry on your Projects list—say ,
“Finish new home upgrades”—or do you write up each of the subprojects as
an individual line item?
Actually , it won’ t matter , as long as you review all the components of the
project as frequently as you need to in order to stay productive. No external
tool or or ganizing format is going to be perfect for sorting both horizontally
across and vertically down through all your projects; you’ll still have to be
aware of the whole in some cohesive way (such as via your W eekly
Review). If you make the lar ge project your one listing on your Projects list,
you’ll want to keep a list of the subprojects and/or the project plan itself as
“project support material” to be reviewed when you come to that major item.
I would recommend doing it this way if big pieces of the project are
dependent on other pieces getting done first.
In that scenario you might have subprojects with no next actions attached to
them because they are in a sense waiting for other things to happen before
they can move forward. For instance, you might not be able to start on
“Upgrade the kitchen” until you have finished “Assess and upgrade home
electrical system.”
Or , you can only af ford one of your major home projects at a time, so
keeping them lined up in order of your priorities would make sense.
However , you might be able to proceed on “Finalize the patio” independent
of the other subprojects.
Y ou would therefore want a next action to be continually current on any
portion of this lar ger project that you could  make progress on independently .
Don’ t be too concerned about which way is best. If you’re not sure, I’d vote
for putting your big projects on the Projects list and holding the sub-pieces
in your project support material, making sure to include them in your
W eekly
Review . That often makes it easier to see the lar ger field of what’ s going on
in your life from a higher perspective, at a glance. But if that arrangement
doesn’ t feel quite right, try including the active and independent subprojects
as separate entries on your master list.
How you list projects and subprojects is up to you; just be sure you know
where to find all the moving parts and review them as frequently as needed
to keep them of f your mind.
There’ s no perfect system for tracking all your projects and subprojects the
same way . Y ou just need to know you have  projects and, if they have
associated components, where to find the appropriate reminders for them .*
Pr oject Support Materials
Project support materials are not project actions, and they’re not project
reminders. They’re resources to support your actions and thinking about
your projects.
Don’ t Use Support Material for Reminding
What continues to talk to you psychologically in your environment,
demanding that you do something about it?
T ypically , people use stacks of paper , stuf fed file folders, and/or a plethora of
e-mails and digital documents as reminders that (1) they’ve got a project,
and (2) they’ve got to do something about it. They’re essentially making
support materials serve as action reminders. The problem is that next actions
and W aiting For items on these projects have usually not been determined
and are psychologically still embedded in the stacks and the files and e-mails
—giving them the aura of just more stuf f that repels its (un)or ganizer instead
of attracting him or her to action. It delivers an incessant subliminal chant:
“Do something about me! Decide something about me! Follow up with
something about me!”
When you’re on the run, in the heat of the activities of the day , files like that
are the last things you’ll want to pick up and peruse for actions. Y ou’ll
actually go
numb to the files and the piles because they don’ t prompt you to do anything
and they simply create more mental noise and emotional anxiety .
If you’re in this kind of situation you must first add the project itself to your
Projects list, as a reminder that there’ s an outcome to be achieved. Then the
action steps and W aiting For items must be put onto their appropriate action
reminder lists. Finally , when it’ s time to actually do  an action, like making a
call to someone about the project, you can pull out all the materials you
think you might need to have as support during the conversation.
T o reiterate, you don’ t  want to use support materials as your primary
reminders of what to do—that should be relegated to your action lists. If,
however , the materials contain project plans and overviews in addition to ad
hoc archival and reference information, you may want to keep them a little
more visibly accessible than you do the pure reference materials in your
filing cabinet or on your computer . These are fine to store support stuf f, too,
as long as you have the discipline to pull out the file drawer or open the
computer to the proper directory and files and take a look at the plans every
time you do your W eekly Review . If not, you’re better of f storing those
kinds of project support files (perhaps with printouts from computer files) in
a standing file holder or a separate Pending stack tray on your desk or other
visually available surface.
T o return to the previous example of moving into a new residence, you could
have a folder labeled “Upgrades—37 Pinkerton Place” containing all the
plans and details and notes about the patio and kitchen and of fice area. In
your W eekly Review , when you came to “Upgrade new residence” on your
Projects list, you’d pull out the file for that project and thumb through all
your notes to ensure that you weren’ t missing any possible next actions.
Those actions would then get done, delegated, or deferred to your action
lists, and the folder would be refiled until you needed it again for doing the
actions or for your next W eekly Review .
Many people who interact with current and prospective clients have
attempted to use client folders and/or client-relationship-management
(CRM) software to “manage the account.” The problem here is that some
material is just facts or historical data that needs to be stored as background
for when you might be able to use it, and some of what must be tracked are
the actions required to move the relationships forward. The latter can be
more ef fectively or ganized within your action-lists system. Client
information is just that, and it can be folded into a general-reference file on
the client or stored within a clients-focused library . But if I need to call a
client, I don’ t want that reminder embedded anywhere but on a Calls list. *
Organizing Ad Hoc Pr oject Thinking
In chapter 3, I suggested that you will often have ideas that you’ll want to
keep about projects but that are not necessarily next actions. Those ideas fall
into the broad category of “project support materials,” and may be anything
from a notion about something you might want to do on your next vacation
to a clarification of some major components in a project plan. These
thoughts could come as you’re driving down the freeway listening to a news
story on the radio, or reading a relevant article. What do you do with that
kind of material?
There is no need ever to lose an idea about a project, theme, or topic.
My recommendation here is that you consider where you’re keeping tabs on
the project or topic itself, how you might add information to it in that format,
and where you might store any more extensive data associated with it. Most
professionals will have several options for how to handle support materials,
including attaching notes to a list item, or ganizing digital information in e-
mail and/or databases, and maintaining paper -based files and notes in
notebooks.
Attached Notes Most or ganizing software allows you to attach a digital note
to a list or calendar entry . If you’re keeping a Projects list within the
software, you can go to the project you had a thought about, open or attach a
note to it, and type in your idea. This is an excellent way to capture “back of
the envelope”
project thinking. If your Projects list is paper based, you can attach a Post-it
note next to the item on your master list or , if you’re a low-tech type, on the
item’ s separate sheet. In any case, you’ll need to remember to look at the
attachment when you review your project to make use of the data.
E-mail and Softwar e Applications The digital world of fers an infinite variety
of ways to deal with project thoughts. E-mails that might contain good
information related to your projects can be held in a dedicated e-mail
reference folder , labeled accordingly . If you have a lar ge volume of e-mails
related to one project, consider creating two folders: “Johnson Partnership—
Active” and “Johnson Partnership—Archive,” or some such. Y ou may also
find it worthwhile, if you don’ t have one already , to set up a more rigorous
kind of digital database for or ganizing your thinking on a project or topic.
An enormous flowering of such
tools has happened in this century—from simple and elegant cloud-based
note-taking and notebook-or ganizing software that permits infinite
customization for how it’ s used, to group-sharing file and project
management systems, to personal project-or ganizing applications for
everything from free-form mind mapping to or ganizing lar ge writing and
research endeavors.
The inherent danger in the digital world is how much data can be spread into
how many dif ferent places so easily , without coordinating links.
The bad news about the good news of the huge assortment of options for
digital project support is the ease with which we are seduced into spreading
potentially meaningful information into such a multiplicity of locations and
mechanisms that it can take us almost back to square one: we don’ t know
where it all is, can’ t see it all integrated for appropriate overviewing from the
right perspective at the right time, aren’ t sure exactly how to put what data
where . . .
so we wind up trying to keep it all coordinated back in our heads! I
continually find interesting new ways to track relevant information for
various things I’m doing, but I retain sanity only when I keep a clearly
delineated and accessible Projects list and ensure that I’m scanning across
any related parts of my system regularly for pertinent details.
Paper -Based Files Having a separate file folder devoted to each project
makes a lot of sense when you’re accumulating paper -based materials; it
may be low-tech, but it’ s an elegant solution nonetheless. Simplicity and
ease of handling make for a good general-reference filing system—one that
lets you feel comfortable about creating a folder for scraps of paper from a
meeting. At times it’ s easier to overview and access project-related
information for planning sessions and conversations using a physical folder
than trying to use the digital pieces themselves in the moment. I will often
print all potentially useful items pertaining to the project—spreadsheets,
schedules, e-mails, W eb pages, etc.—to have in hand as reference for those
kinds of interactions.
Pages in Notebooks A great advantage of paper -based loose-leaf notebooks
is that you can dedicate a whole page or group of pages to an individual
project.
For years I maintained a midsize notebook with a Projects list in front and a
Project Support section toward the back, where I always had some blank
pages
to capture any random thinking or plans and details about projects on my
list.
Though paper -based personal system components are increasingly giving
way to their digital counterparts, the notebook model is a valuable one,
supporting a more integrated and multilevel platform for well-oriented
thinking.
Each of the methods previously described can be ef fective in or ganizing
project thoughts. The key is that you must consistently look for any action
steps inherent in your project notes, and review the notes themselves as often
as you think it is necessary , given the nature of the project.
Y ou’ll also want to clear out many of your notes once they become inactive,
unreal, or redundant, to keep the whole system from catching the “stale”
virus.
I’ve found a lot of value in capturing these types of thoughts, more for the
way it consistently helps my thinking process than because I end up using
every idea (most I don’ t!). But I try to make sure not to let my old thoughts
stay around too long, pretending they’re useful when they’re not.
Or ganizing Nonactionable Data
Interestingly , one of the biggest problems with most people’ s personal
management systems is that they blend a few actionable things with a lar ge
amount of data and material that has value but no action attached. Having
good, consistent structures with which to manage the nonactionable items in
our work and lives is as important as managing our action and project
reminders. When the nonactionable items aren’ t properly managed, they
clog up the whole process.
Nonactionable items fall into three lar ge categories: reference materials,
reminders of things that need no action now but might at a later date, and
things that you don’ t need at all (trash).
Refer ence Materials
Much of what comes across your desk and into your life in general is
reference material. There’ s no action required, but it’ s information that you
want to keep, for a variety of reasons. Y our major decisions will be how
much to keep, how much room to dedicate to it, what form it should be
stored in, and where. Much of that will be a personal or or ganizational
judgment call based upon legal or
logistical concerns or personal preferences. The only time you should have
attention on your reference material is when you need to change your system
in some way because you have too much or too little information, given your
needs or preferences.
The problem most people have psychologically with all their stuf f is that it’ s
still stuff —that is, they haven’ t decided what’ s actionable and what’ s not.
Once you’ve made a clean distinction about which is which, what’ s left as
reference should have no pull or incompletion associated with it—it’ s just
your library .
Y our only decision then is how big a library you want. When you’ve fully
implemented this action-management methodology , you can be as big a pack
rat as your space (physical and digital) will allow . As I’ve increased the size
of the hard disk on my computer and added an almost infinite backup
capability on attached drives and in the cloud, I’ve kept that much more e-
mail in my archives and that many more digital photographs. The more the
merrier , as far as I’m concerned, since increasing the volume of pure
reference material adds no psychological weight.
The V ariety of Refer ence Systems
Reference material now shows up in many forms (topics and media), with
numerous ways to or ganize it. What follows is a brief discussion of some of
the most common.
General-reference filing—paper , e-mail, and simple digital storage Lar ge-
category filing
Contact managers
Libraries and archives
Y our reference and filing system should be a simple library of data, easily
retrievable—not your reminder for actions, projects, priorities, or prospects.
General-Refer ence Filing As I’ve emphasized in previous chapters, a good
filing system is critical for processing and or ganizing your stuf f. It’ s also a
must for dealing with the paper -based material and ad hoc digital
information that are valuable to you for one reason or another , and you’ll
need a way to store both.
Ideally you already set up a general-reference filing system as you were
processing “in.” Y ou need to feel comfortable storing even a single piece of
paper that you might want to refer to later , or an article you read online, and
your general-reference system must be informal and accessible enough that
it’ s a snap to file something away , right at hand where you do your work and
personal administration and review . If you’re not set up that way yet, look
back at chapter 4 for help on this topic.
Most people wind up needing from one to four physical file drawers, many
dozens of e-mail reference folders, and other digital storage locations and
categories that can range from a few to hundreds .*  The W eb itself is nothing
more than a huge digital filing cabinet, which both relieves the need to create
your own digital reference library and produces a huge amount of the type of
information that you will likely want to collect and or ganize within your
own system. The ever -increasing plethora of information and ways to access
and or ganize it only forces the necessity to distinguish nonactionable from
actionable inputs, and to create and maintain an easily usable system of
reference data storage.
Lar ge-Category Filing Any topic that requires more than fifty folders and/or
major documents should probably be given its own section, drawer , or
digital database, with its own alpha-sorted or other easily searchable system.
For instance, if you’re managing a corporate mer ger and need to keep hold
of a lot of the paperwork, you may want to dedicate two or three whole file
cabinets to hold all the documentation required in the due-diligence process.
If gardening or sailing or cooking is your passion, you may need at least a
whole file drawer for each of those designated hobbies.
Bear in mind that if your area of focus has support material that could blend
into other areas of focus, you may run into the dilemma of whether to store
the information in general reference or in the specialized reference files.
When you read a great article about wood fencing and want to keep it, does
that go in your Garden cabinet or in the general system with other
information about home-related projects? As a rule, it’ s best to stick with
one general-reference system except for a very limited number of discrete
topics.
Contact Managers Much of the information that you need to keep is directly
related to people in your network. Y ou need to track contact information of
all sorts—mobile, home, and of fice phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and so
on. In addition, if you find it useful, you may want to maintain information
about their
birthdays, names of family members, hobbies, interests, etc. In a more
rigorous professional vein, you may need or want to track hire dates,
performance-review dates, goals and objectives, and other potentially
relevant data for staf f development and legal purposes.
The “contacts” section of most of the digital and paper or ganizers (along
with the calendar) has probably been the most commonly used component.
Everyone needs to keep track of phone numbers and e-mail addresses. It’ s
instructive to note that this is purely and simply reference material. No
action is required—this is just information that you might need to access in
the future. As digital as the world seems to have become, many people still
have stacks of collected business cards that are subtly yelling at them,
“Decide something about me! Do something with me!”
But once you have filtered actionable items out of those inputs, there’ s no
big mystery about how to or ganize contact information, aside from the
logistics for your individual needs. Again, the only problem comes up when
people try to make their contact manager serve as a tool for reminding them
about things they need to do. That doesn’ t work (unless it’ s part of a well-
functioning CRM
system that includes both customer information and action triggers
appropriately assigned and incorporated). As long as all the actions relative
to people you know have been identified and tracked in your action reminder
lists, there’ s no role for a contact manager to fill other than being a data
store.
The only issue (or opportunity) then becomes how much information you
need to keep and where and in what equipment you need to keep it in order
to have it accessible when you want it. Nothing’ s perfect in that regard, but
as the mobile digital Internet-connected tools increase in power , along with
their connection to various data stores, both the ease of access and the
confusion of options will increase in this regard.
Libraries and Ar chives: Personalized Levels
If material is purely for reference, the only issue is whether it’ s worth the
time and space to keep it.
Information that might be useful lives at many levels. Y ou could probably
find out pretty much anything if you were willing to dig deep enough. The
question of how much to keep, how close, and in what form will be a
changing reality ,
given the variables of your needs, your particular comfort levels with data,
and the technology that turbochar ges your relationship to global information.
Relative to your personal or ganization and productivity , this is not a core
issue, so long as all of your projects and actions are in a control system that
you work with regularly . Reference material in all its forms then becomes
nothing more or less than material to capture and create access to according
to your particular proclivities, requirements, and capabilities.
Some degree of consistency will always make things easier . What kinds of
things do you need with you all the time? Those must go into your
ubiquitously available mobile device or notebook. What do you need for
meetings or of f-site events? That should be put into your briefcase, pack,
satchel, or purse. What might you need when you’re working in your of fice?
That should be put into your personal filing system or your networked
computer . What about rare situations relative to your job? Material needed
for those could be archived in departmental files, of f-site storage, or deep in
the digital cloud. What could you find on the W eb anytime you might need
it? Y ou don’ t need to do anything with that information, unless you require it
when you’re away from a good Internet connection, in which case you
should print the data out when you’re online and store it in a file you can
take with you.
Do you see how that personal or ganization of reference material is simply a
logistical and purpose-based one? Distinguishing actionable from
nonactionable things is the first key success factor in this arena. Second is
determining what your potential use of the information is, and therefore
where and how it should be stored. Once these are addressed, you have total
freedom to manage and or ganize as much or as little reference material as
you want. There is no
“perfect” reference system. Its structures and content demand a highly
individual decision that ought to be based on the ratio of the value received
to the time and ef fort required for capturing and maintaining it. Y ou are
better of f starting with real information you want to keep, deciding the best
place to put it so it’ s retrievable, and crafting that from the ground up than
trying to choose or design a system theoretically . Y ou will definitely hone
your reference libraries into a lar ger , more sensible framework as time goes
on, but that will best be built from upgrading how you’re managing your
day-to-day realities. T olerate some ambiguity here, in terms of figuring out
the best way to do it all. The key will be some regular overviewing and
reassessment of your system, and dynamically course-correcting as needed.
Someday/Maybes
Someday/Maybes are not throwaway items. They may be some of the most
interesting and creative things you’ll ever get involved with.
The second thing to deal with in or ganizing nonactionable items is how to
track things that you want to reassess in the future. These could range from a
special trip you might want to take one day , to books you might want to
read, to projects you might want to tackle in the next fiscal year , to skills and
talents you might want to develop. For a full implementation of this model
you’ll need some sort of “back burner” or “on hold” component.
There are several ways to stage things for later review , all of which will
work to get them of f your current radar and your mind. Y ou can put the
items on various versions of Someday/Maybe lists or trigger them on your
calendar or in a digital or paper -based tickler system.
Someday/Maybe List
It’ s highly likely that if you did a complete mind sweep when you were
collecting things from your mental space, you came up with some things
you’re not sure you want to commit to. “Learn Spanish,” “Get Marcie a
horse,” “Climb Mt. W ashington,” “W rite a mystery novel,” and “Get a
vacation cottage” are typical projects that fall into this category .
If you haven’ t already done it, I recommend that you create a
Someday/Maybe list in whatever or ganizing system you’ve chosen. Then
give yourself permission to populate that list with all the items of that type
that have occurred to you so far . Y ou’ll probably discover that simply having
the list and starting to fill it out will cause you to come up with all kinds of
creative ideas.
Activating and maintaining your Someday/Maybe category unleashes the
flow of your creative thinking—you have permission to imagine cool things
to do without having to commit to doing anything about them yet.
Y ou may also be surprised to find that some of the things you write on the
list will actually come to pass, almost without your making any conscious
ef fort
to make them happen. If you acknowledge the power of the imagination to
foster changes in perception and performance, it’ s easy to see how having a
Someday/Maybe list out in front of your conscious mind could potentially
add many wonderful adventures to your life and work. W e’re likely to seize
opportunities when they arise if we’ve already identified and captured them
as a possibility . That has certainly been my own experience: learning to play
the flute and how to sail in the open ocean started in this category for me. In
addition to your in-tray , there are two rich sources to tap for your
Someday/Maybe list: your creative imagination and your list of current
projects.
Make an Inventory of Y our Cr eative Imaginings What are the things you
really might want to do someday if you have the time, money , and
inclination? W rite them on your Someday/Maybe list. T ypical categories
include:
Things to get or build for your home
Hobbies to take up
Skills to learn
Creative expressions to explore
Clothes and accessories to buy
T oys (hi-tech and otherwise!) to acquire
T rips to take
Or ganizations to join
Service projects to contribute to
Things to see and do
Reassess Y our Curr ent Pr ojects Now’ s a good time to review your Projects
list from a more elevated perspective (that is, the standpoint of your job,
goals, and personal commitments) and consider whether you might transfer
some of your current commitments to Someday/Maybe. If on reflection you
realize that an optional project doesn’ t have a chance of getting your
attention for the next few months or more, move it to this list.
People have at times found it useful even to subcategorize their
Someday/Maybe projects. There might be a significant dif ference for you to
think about projects you really want to do around your home as soon as you
have the resources versus your “bucket list” kind of fantasies, such as
climbing a mountain in Nepal or creating a foundation for disadvantaged
kids. In a company this might be a distinction between “parking lot” ideas
(“Let’ s save
that to discuss at our next quarterly meeting”) and keeping track of the
projects you might ener gize when and if significant capital shows up. The
key here is to pay attention, as you experiment with these options, to
whether your lists and subcategories are unnerving or ener gizing you.
Special Categories of Someday/Maybe
More than likely you have some special interests that involve lots of possible
things to do. It can be fun to collect these on lists. For instance: Food—
recipes, menus, restaurants, wines
Children—things to do with them
Books to read
Music to download
Movies to see
Gift ideas
W eb sites to explore
W eekend trips to take
Ideas—Misc. (meaning you don’ t know where else to put them!)
These kinds of lists can be a cross between reference and Someday/Maybe—
reference because you can just collect and add to lists of good wines or
restaurants or books, to consult as you like; Someday/Maybe because you
might want to review the listed items on a regular basis to remind yourself to
try one or more of them at some point.
In any case, this is another great reason to have an or ganizing system that
makes it easy to capture things that may add value and variety and interest to
your life—without clogging your mind and work space with undecided,
unfinished business.
The Danger of “Hold and Review” Files and Piles
What lies in our power to do, lies in our power not to do.
—Aristotle
Many people have created some sort of “Hold and Review” pile or file (or
whole drawer or e-mail folder) that vaguely fits within the category of
Someday/Maybe. They tell themselves, “When I have time, I may like to get
to this,” and a “Hold and Review” file seems a convenient place to put it. I
personally don’ t recommend this particular kind of subsystem, because in
virtually every case I have come across, the person held but didn’ t review ,
and there was numbness and resistance about the stack and contents. The
value of someday/maybe disappears if you don’ t put your conscious
awareness back onto it with some consistency .
Also, there’ s a big dif ference between something that’ s managed well, as a
Someday/Maybe list, and something that’ s just a catchall bucket for stuf f.
Usually much of that stuf f needs to be tossed, some of it needs to go into
Read/Review , some needs to be filed as reference, some belongs on the
calendar or in a tickler file (see page 182)  for review in a month or perhaps
at the beginning of the next quarter , and some items actually have next
actions on them. Many times, after appropriately processing someone’ s
“Hold and Review”
drawer or file, I’ve discovered there was nothing left in it!
Using the Calendar for Futur e Options
Y our calendar can be a very handy place to park reminders of things you
might  want to consider doing in the future. Most of the people I’ve coached
were not nearly as comfortable with their calendars as they could have been;
otherwise they probably would have found many more things to put in there.
One of the three uses of a calendar is for day-specific information . This
category can include a number of things, but one of the most creative ways
to utilize the calendar function is to enter things that you want to take of f
your mind and reassess at some later date. Here are a few of the myriad
things you should consider inserting:
T riggers for activating projects
Events you might want to participate in
Decision catalysts
T riggers for Activating Pr ojects If you have a project that you don’ t really
need to think about now but that deserves a flag at some point in the future,
you can pick an appropriate date and put a reminder about the project in your
calendar
for that day . It should go in some day-specific (versus time-specific)
calendar slot for the things you want to be reminded of on that day; then
when the day arrives, you see the reminder and insert the item as an active
project on your Projects list. T ypical candidates for this treatment are:
Special events with a certain lead time for handling (product launches, fund-
raisers, etc.)
Regular events that you need to prepare for , such as budget reviews, annual
conferences, planning events, or meetings (e.g., when should you add next
year ’ s “Annual sales conference” or “Get kids set up for next school year”
to your Projects list?)
Key dates for significant people that you might want to do something about
(birthdays, anniversaries, holiday gift giving, etc.)
Events Y ou Might W ant to Participate In Y ou probably get notices constantly
about seminars, conferences, speeches, and social and cultural events that
you may want to decide about attending as the time gets closer . So figure out
when that closer time is and put a trigger in your calendar on the appropriate
date—for example:
“Chamber of Commerce breakfast tomorrow?”
“Lions football tickets go on sale today”
“BBC special on climate change at 8:00 p.m.”
“Garden Club tea next Saturday”
If you can think of any jogs like these that you’d like to put into your
system, do it now .
It’ s OK to decide not to decide—as long as you have a decide-not-to-decide
system.
Decision Catalysts Once in a while there may be a significant decision that
you need to make but can’ t (or don’ t want to) right away . That’ s fine, in
terms of your own self-management process, as long as you’ve concluded
that the additional information you need has to come from an internal  rather
than an external  source (e.g., you need to sleep on it), or there is a good
reason to delay your decision until a last responsible moment (allowing all
factors to be as
current as possible before you choose how to move on it). But in order to
move to a level of OK-ness about not  deciding, you’d better put out a safety
net that you can trust to get you to focus on the issue appropriately in the
future. A calendar reminder can serve that purpose. *
Some typical decision areas in this category include:
Hire/fire
Mer ge/acquire/sell/divest
Change job/career
Potential strategy redirection
This is a big topic to devote so little space to, I know , but go ahead and ask
yourself, “Is there any major decision for which I should create a future
trigger , so I can feel comfortable just ‘hanging out’ with it for now?” If there
is, put some reminder in your calendar to revisit the issue.
The “T ickler” File
One elegant way to manage nonactionable items that may need an action in
the future is the tickler file .*  A three-dimensional version of a calendar , the
original version of this allows you to hold physical  reminders of things that
you want to see or remember—not now , but in the future. It can be an
extremely functional tool, allowing you to in ef fect set up your own postal
service and “mail” things to yourself for receipt on a designated future date.
I have used a tickler file for years. Even though technology has made
reminders of this sort more easily digitized in software and mobile access
devices, it’ s possible that numerous things for you are more easily managed
in this low-tech manner . The promise of digital management of such things
is marching forward incessantly , but there remain many things in my
personal system that are more ef ficiently managed by physical particles as
reminders.
Essentially the tickler file is a simple file-folder system that allows you to
distribute paper and other physical reminders in such a way that whatever
you want to see on a particular date in the future “automatically” shows up
that day in your in-tray .
If you have a secretary or assistant, you can entrust at least a part of this task
to him or her , assuming that he or she has some working version of this or a
similar system. T ypical examples would be:
“Hand me this agenda the morning of the day I have the meeting.”
“Give this back to me on Monday to rethink, since it applies to our board
meeting on W ednesday .”
“Remind me about the Hong Kong trip two weeks ahead, and we’ll plan the
logistics.”
Then every day of the week, that day’ s folder is pulled and reviewed.
Even if you are in a high-level professional role, while you can (and
probably should) utilize staf f to handle as much of this as is appropriate, I
recommend that, if you can integrate it into your lifestyle, you maintain your
own tickler file functionality . There are many useful things you can do, at
least some of which you may want to avail yourself of outside the pale of
your assistant’ s responsibilities. I use my tickler file to manage travel
documents I need at hand on a certain day , reminders of birthdays and
special events upcoming (that would take up too much visual room on my
digital calendar), printouts of interesting things to explore when I might have
more time in a couple of months, etc.
Bottom line: the tickler file demands only a one-second-per -day new
behavior to make it work, and it has a payof f value exponentially greater
than the personal investment. It represents a unique executive function:
deciding not to decide until a certain point.
Setting Up a T ickler File If you are doing this in a physical system, you need
forty-three folders—thirty-one labeled “1” through “31,” and twelve more
labeled with the names of the months of the year . The daily files are kept in
front, beginning with the file for tomorrow’ s date (if today is October 5, then
the first file would be “6”). The succeeding daily files represent the days of
the rest of the month (“6” through “31”). Behind the “31” file is the monthly
file for the next month (“November”), and behind that are the daily files “1”
through “5.”
Following that are the rest of the monthly files (“December” through
“October”).
The next daily file is emptied into your in-tray every day , and then the folder
is refiled at the back of the dailies (at which point, instead of October 6, it
represents November  6). In the same way , when the next monthly file
reaches the front (on October 31 after you empty the daily file, the
“November” file will be the next one, with the daily files “1” through “31”
behind it), it’ s emptied into the in-tray and refiled at the back of the
monthlies to represent November a year from now . This is a perpetual file,
meaning that at any given time it contains
files for the next thirty-one days and the next twelve months.
The big advantage of using file folders for your tickler system is that they
allow you to store actual documents (the form that needs to be filled out on a
certain day , the meeting agenda that needs to be reviewed then, the invoice
that you’re holding payment on until that day , etc.).
FILE-FOLDER-STYLE SETUP (OCT OBER 5)
In order for the system to work, you must check and update it every day . If
you for get to empty the daily file, you won’ t trust the system to handle
important data, and you’ll have to manage those things some other way . If
you leave town (or don’ t access the file on the weekend), you must be sure
to check the folders for the days you’ll be away , befor e  you go.
Checklists: Creative and Constructive Reminders
The last topic in personal system or ganization that deserves some attention is
the care and feeding of checklists, those “recipes of potential ingredients” for
projects, work processes and procedures, events, and areas of value, interest,
and responsibility . In essence, any of the lists or categories of reminders
we’ve already discussed are checklists, in that they serve the function of
providing things to check or review to ensure that you’re not missing
something in that area. The more common idea of checklists, however , refers
to a listing of the contents of a topic, procedure, or some arena of interest or
activity , to be utilized either at a specific time or whenever you engage in a
particular kind of activity .
These can range from big-picture outlines of areas of focus in your job or
your life down to the detailed instructions of how to load pictures onto a
W eb site.
Many years ago Alfred North Whitehead cogently observed, “Civilization
advances by extending the number of important operations which we can
perform without thinking about them.” Checklists provide the micro version
of that macro observation: whenever you have to think about anything, either
because of some regularity of a refreshed view (“At the end of every
calendar year , I want/need to . . .”) or a specific situation that requires more
detail than you can easily recall (“Before I deliver a seminar , I need to . . .”),
you should entrust those jobs to your “external mind”—your management
system that holds the details you need to engage with at appropriate times. *
There are an infinite number of possible checklists that allow you to have
more relaxed control in various situations across your life and work. If you
ever refer to a recipe in a cookbook in order to prepare a specific dish,
you’re using a checklist to boost your focus and productivity . If your board
has tasked you with three key initiatives or outcomes for the year , reviewing
those prior to your board meeting would be utilizing a checklist.
Because I am describing the process of clarifying and or ganizing what may
be on your mind, to begin to implement this system I’ll focus on a common
set of topics that emer ge for people, for which checklists are often the best
solution.
Things Y ou W ant to Pay Attention T o
Often, when we are working with people to clear up what is on their minds,
what shows up are things like this:
Exercise more regularly
Spend more quality time with my kids
Do more proactive planning for my division
Maintain good morale on my team
Ensure we’re in alignment with corporate strategy
Keep the client billing process up-to-date
Focus more on my spiritual practices
Pay more attention to the individual goals of my staf f members
Keep myself motivated in my job
Keep current conversations and updates going with key people in my
company
What should you do with these “fuzzier” kinds of internal commitments and
areas of attention?
First, Identify Inher ent Pr ojects and Action
For much of this kind of stuf f, there is still a project and/or an action that
needs to be defined. “Exercise more regularly” r eally  translates for many
people into
“Set up regular exercise program” (project) and “Call Sally for suggestion
about gyms and personal trainers” (real action step). In such cases, inherent
projects and actions still need to be clarified and or ganized into a personal
system. Or
“Maintain good morale on my team” should become a project (“Explore
team-building processes for my department”) with a specific action step (“E-
mail our HR director to get her input on this opportunity”).
But there ar e some things that don’ t quite fit into that category , and often,
appropriate checklists are needed to address them.
Blueprinting Key Ar eas of W ork and Accountability
Objectives like “Maintain good physical conditioning” or “Keep my team
motivated” may still need to be built into some sort of overview checklist
that will be reviewed regularly . Y ou have multiple layers of outcomes and
standards playing on your psyche and your choices at any point in time, and
knowing what those are, at all the dif ferent levels, is always a good idea (and
yet not so easy to habitually maintain and adhere to).
I suggested earlier that there are at least six levels of your “work” that could
be defined and that each level deserves its own acknowledgment and
evaluation.
A complete inventory of everything you hold important and are committed
to on each of these levels would represent an awesome checklist. It might
include: Career goals
Service
Family
Relationships
Community
Health and ener gy
Financial resources
Creative expression
And then moving down a level, within your job, you might want some
reminders of your key areas of responsibility , your staf f, your values, and so
on.
A list of these might contain points like:
T eam morale
Processes
T imelines
Staf f issues
W orkload
Communications
T echnology
All of these items could in turn be included on the lists in your personal
system, as reminders to you, as needed, to keep the ship on course, on an
even keel. Many times the value is simply to af firm that the specific area is
OK as is; nothing needs to be added or changed. But knowing  that adds to
your relaxed focus.
The Mor e Novel the Situation, the Mor e Contr ol Requir ed  The degree to
which any of us needs to maintain checklists and external controls is directly
related to our unfamiliarity with the area of responsibility . If you’ve been
doing what you’re doing for a long time, and there’ s no pressure on you to
change in that area, you probably need minimal external personal
or ganization to stay on cruise control. Y ou know when things must happen
and how to make them happen, and your system is fine, status quo. Y ou
could manage those in your sleep. Often, though, that’ s not the case.
Did you ever have to go through some prescribed procedure to manage a
discrete kind of financial transaction, log in and refresh a software
application, or even go through several necessary steps to check in to a
friend’ s vacation cabin, and you had the experience of asking yourself, “W ait
a minute, what do I need to do, now?” In any of those situations you may
want or need to repeat, you need a checklist. I am dangerously semiliterate
in terms of computers and software, and whenever I get instruction from our
IT experts about how to fix some recurring glitch, it is easy to convince
myself I will remember what they told me. I have learned (too many times
the hard way) to create checklists for them.
Checklists can be highly useful to let you know what you don’ t  need to be
concerned about.
Many times you’ll want some sort of checklist to help you maintain a focus
until you’re more familiar with what you’re doing. If your CEO suddenly
disappeared, for example, and you instantly had to fill her shoes, you’d need
some overview and outlines in front of you for a while to ensure that you
had all the mission-critical aspects of the job handled. And if you’ve just
been hired into a new position, with new responsibilities that are relatively
unfamiliar to you, you’ll want a framework of control and structure, if only
for the first few months. As we have instituted a novel or ganizational
structure and operating system in our company , we have been using many
critical checklists to support our meeting practices for its implementation,
until they become automatic.
There have been times when I needed to make a list of areas that I had to
handle temporarily , until things were under control. For instance, when my
wife and I decided to create a brand-new structure for a business we’d been
involved with for many years, I took on areas of responsibility I’d never had
to deal with
before—namely , accounting, computers, marketing, legal, and
administration.
For several months I needed to keep a checklist of those responsibilities in
front of me to ensure that I filled in the blanks everywhere and managed the
transition as well as I could. After the business got onto “cruise control” to
some degree, I no longer needed that list.
Checklists at All Levels
Be open to creating any kind of checklist as the ur ge strikes you. The
possibilities are endless—from “Core Life V alues” to “Things to T ake
Camping” to “Potential Holiday Gifts.” Making lists, ad hoc, as they occur
to you, is one of the most powerful yet subtlest and simplest procedures that
you can install in your life.
T o spark your creative thinking, here’ s a list of some of the topics of
checklists I’ve seen and used over the years:
Job Areas of Responsibility (key responsibility areas)
Exercise Regimens (muscle resistance training programs)
T ravel Checklist (everything to take on or do before a trip)
W eekly Review (everything to review and/or update on a weekly basis)
T raining Program Components (all the things to handle when putting on an
event, front to back)
Key Clients
People to Stay in T ouch W ith (all the people you might want to connect with
in your network)
Y ear -end Activities (all the actions for closing up for the time period)
Personal Development (things to evaluate regularly to ensure personal
balance and progress)
Jokes
Get comfortable with checklists, both ad hoc and more permanent. Be ready
to create and eliminate them as required. Make sure you have an easily
accessed place to put a new list that’ s also attractive and even fun to engage
with—in a loose-leaf notebook or in a software application that is readily
available.
Appropriately used, checklists can be a tremendous asset in enhancing
personal productivity and relieving mental pressure.
Capability and willingness to instantly make a checklist, accessible and used
when needed, is a core component of high-performance self-management.
If in fact you have now captur ed everything that represents an open loop in
your life and work, clarified  and processed each one of those items in terms
of what it means to you and what actions are required, and or ganized  the
results into an intact system that holds a current and complete overview—
lar ge and small—of all your present and “someday” projects, then you’re
ready for the next step of implementation in the art of stress-free
productivity: the reflection process.
