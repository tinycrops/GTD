# Chapter 6: Clarifying: Getting “In” to Empty

Clarifying: Getting “In” to Empty
ASSUMING THA T YOU have collected everything that has your
attention, your job now is to actually get to the bottom of “in.” Getting “in”
to empty doesn’ t mean actually doing all the actions and projects that
you’ve captured. It just means identifying each item and deciding what it is,
what it means, and what you’re going to do with it.
T o get an overview of this process, you may find it useful here to refer to
the W orkflow Diagram on page  123. The center column illustrates all the
steps involved in processing and deciding your next actions.
This chapter focuses on the components in the diagram’ s center column, the
steps from “in” to next action. Y ou’ll immediately see the natural
or ganization that results from following this process for each of your open
loops. For instance, if you pick up something from “in” and realize, “I’ve
got to call Andrea about that, but I’ve got to do it on Monday , when she’ s in
her of fice,” then you’ll defer that action immediately and enter it on your
calendar for Monday .
I recommend that you read through this chapter and the next one, on
or ganizing your actions, before you actually start processing what you’ve
captured in “in.” It may save you some steps. When I coach people through
this process, it invariably becomes a dance back and forth between the
simple decision-making stage of pr ocessing  the open loops and the trickier
task of figuring out the best way to enter these decisions in their particular
or ganization  systems.

WORKFLOW DIAGRAM—PROCESSING
Many of the people we work with, for example, are eager to get set up on a
mobile device that might synchronize with the enterprise application that
their company is using for e-mail and scheduling. The first thing we would
have to do (after we’ve collected the in-tray) is make sure all their hardware
and software are working. Then we clean up (print out and erase, usually)
everything they have previously tried to or ganize in their task lists and put it
all into “in.” Then we establish some working categories such as “Calls,”
“Errands,” “Agendas,”
“At Computer ,” and so on. As we begin to process the in-tray , the person
can go immediately to his computer and type his action steps directly into
the system he will ultimately depend on.
If you’re not sure yet what you’re going to be using as a personal reminder
system, don’ t worry . Y ou can begin very appropriately with a simple loose-
leaf notebook or whatever you may be currently using for making lists. Y ou
can always upgrade your tools later , once you have your system in place.
Processing Guidelines
The best way to learn this model is by doing. But there are a few basic rules
to follow:
Process the top item first.
Process one item at a time.
Never put anything back into “in.”
T op Item First
Pr ocess  does not mean “spend time on.”
Even if the second item down is a personal note to you from the head of
your country and the top item is a piece of junk mail, you’ve got to process
the junk mail first! That’ s an exaggeration to make a point, but the principle
is an important one: everything gets processed equally . The verb pr ocess
does not mean “spend time on.” It just means “decide what the thing is and
what action is
required, and then dispatch it accordingly .” Y ou’re going to get to the
bottom of the tray as soon as you can anyway , and you don’ t want to avoid
dealing with anything  in there.
Emergency Scanning Is Not Clarifying
Most people get to their in-tray or their e-mail and look for the most ur gent,
most fun, easiest, or most interesting stuf f to deal with first. “Emer gency
scanning” is fine and necessary sometimes (I do it regularly , too). Maybe
you’ve just come back from an of f-site meeting and have to be on a long
conference call in fifteen minutes. So you check to make sure there are no
land mines about to explode and to see if your client has e-mailed back to
you OK’ing the big proposal.
But that’ s not processing your in-tray; it’ s emer gency scanning. When
you’re in processing mode, you must get into the habit of starting at one end
and just cranking through items one at a time, in order . As soon as you
break that rule and process only what you feel like processing, in whatever
order , you’ll invariably begin to leave things unprocessed. Then you will no
longer have a functioning funnel, and it will back up all over your desk and
of fice and e-mail
“in” repositories. Many people live in this emer gency-scanning mode,
always distracted by what’ s coming into “in,” and not feeling comfortable if
they’re not constantly skimming the contents on their computer or mobile
devices. W ere they to trust “in” would be totally dealt with every day or
two, they wouldn’ t be so driven by this need for incessant checking.
LIFO or FIFO?
The in-tray is a processing station, not a storage bin.
Theoretically you should flip your in-tray upside down and process first the
first thing that came in. As long as you go from one end clear through to the
other within a reasonable period of time, though, it won’ t make much
dif ference.
Y ou’re going to see it all in short order anyway . And if you’re going to
attempt to clear up a big backlog of e-mails staged in “in,” you’ll actually
discover it’ s more ef ficient to process the last-in first because of all the
discussion threads that accumulate on top of one another , and you don’ t
want to respond to
something prematurely before you’ve seen the whole discussion.
One Item at a T ime
Y ou may find you have a tendency , while processing your in-tray , to pick
something up, not know exactly what you want to do about it, and then let
your eyes wander to another item farther down the stack and get engaged
with it. That item may be more attractive to you because you know right
away what to do with it—and you don’ t feel like thinking about what’ s in
your hand. This is dangerous territory . What’ s in your hand is likely to land
on a “hmph” stack on the side of your desk because you become distracted
by something easier , more important, or more interesting below it.
Thinking about the stuf f you’ve accumulated usually does not happen
naturally , of its own accord. Y ou must apply conscious ef fort to get yourself
to think, like getting yourself to exercise or clean house.
Most people also want to take a whole stack of things out of the in-tray at
once, put it right in front of them, and try to crank through it all,
immediately .
Although I empathize with the desire to deal with a big chunk, I constantly
remind people to put back everything but the one item on top. The focus on
just one thing forces the requisite attention and decision making to get
through all your stuf f. And if you get interrupted (which is likely), you
won’ t have countless parts of “in” scattered around outside the tray and out
of control again.
The Multitasking Exception
There’ s a subtle exception to the one-item-at-a-time rule. Some personality
types really need to shift their focus away from something for at least a
minute in order to make a decision about it. When I see this going on with
someone, I let him take two or sometimes three things out at once as he’ s
processing. It’ s then easier and faster for him to make a choice about the
action required.
Remember , multitasking is an exception—and it works only if you hold to
the discipline of working through every item in short order , and never avoid
any decision for longer than a minute or two.
Nothing Goes Back into “In”
There’ s a one-way path out of “in.” This is actually what was meant by the
old admonition to “handle things once,” though handling things just once is
in fact a bad idea. If you did that, you’d never have a list, because you
would finish everything as soon as you saw it. Y ou’d also be highly
inef fective and inef ficient, since most things you deal with are not  to be
acted upon the first time you become aware of them. Where the advice does
hold is in eliminating the bad habit of continually picking things up out of
“in,” not deciding what they mean or what you’re going to do about them,
and then just leaving them there. A better admonition would be, “The first
time you pick something up from your in-tray , decide what to do about it
and where it goes. Never put it back in ‘in.’”
The cognitive scientists have now proven the reality of “decision fatigue”—
that every decision you make, little or big, diminishes a limited amount of
your brain power . Deciding to “not decide” about an e-mail or anything else
is another one of those decisions, which drains your psychological fuel
tank.
The Key Processing Question: “What’ s the Next
Action?”
I am rather like a mosquito in a nudist camp; I know what I want to do, but
I don’ t know wher e  to begin.
—Stephen Bayne
Y ou’ve got the message. Y ou’re going to deal with one item at a time. And
you’re going to make a firm next-action decision about each one. This may
sound easy—and it is—but it requires you to do some fast, hard thinking.
Much of the time the action will not be self-evident; it will need to be
determined.
On that first item, for example, do you need to call someone? Fill
something out? Get information from the W eb? Buy something at the store?
T alk to your assistant? E-mail your boss? What? If there’ s an action, its
specific nature will determine the next set of options. But what if you say ,
“There’ s really nothing to do with this”?
What If Ther e Is No Action?
It’ s likely that a portion of your in-tray will require no action. There will be
three types of things in this category:
T rash
Items to incubate
Reference material
T rash
If you’ve been following my suggestions, you’ll no doubt already have
tossed out a big pile of stuf f. It’ s also likely that you will have put stacks of
material into “in” that include things you don’ t need anymore. So don’ t be
surprised if there’ s still a lot more to throw away as you process your stuf f.
Processing all the things in your world will make you more conscious of
what you are going to do and what you should not  be doing. One director of
a foundation I worked with discovered that he had allowed way too many e-
mails (thousands!) to accumulate—e-mails that in fact he wasn’ t ever going
to respond to anyway . He told me that using my method forced him to “go
on a healthy diet” about what he would allow to hang around his world as
an incompletion.
It’ s likely that at some point you’ll come up against the question of whether
or not to keep something for future reference. I have two ways of dealing
with that:
When in doubt, throw it out.
When in doubt, keep it.
T ake your pick. I think either approach is fine. Y ou just need to trust your
intuition and be realistic about your space. Most people have some angst
about all of this because their systems have never really been totally
functional and clear -edged before. If you make a clean distinction between
what’ s reference and supplies and what requires action, and if your
reference system is simple and workable, you can easily keep as much
material as you can accommodate. Since no action is required on it, it’ s just
a matter of physical space and logistics. How big would you like your
reference library and toolbox to be?
T oo much information creates the same result as too little: you don’ t have
what you need, when and in the way you need it.
Filing experts can of fer you more detailed guidelines about all this, and
your accountant can provide record-retention timetables that will tell you
how long you should keep what kinds of financial documentation. My
suggestion is that you discriminate about whether something is actionable
or not. Once it’ s clear that no action is needed, there’ s room for lots of
options, given your personal preferences and storage and access
capabilities.
The digital world of fers additional opportunities and challenges around the
what-to-keep vs. what-to-throw-away decision. Because computer and
cloud storage spaces seem continually to grow exponentially , the good news
is that we are forever getting much more room to store much more stuf f.
Additional good news is the powerful search functionality that has grown
along with it. The bad news is that it can easily foster indiscriminate filing
and a lot of numbness to the volume and confusion about where things are,
even as good as search functions might be. Because digital storage, without
much forethought, has become almost automatic, it is very possible to
create an environment of constant input but no utilization. Y ou are creating
a library so big and overwhelming, you have limited your capacity to make
it functional for the work that’ s important for you to do.
The key here is the regular reviewing and pur ging of outdated information,
as I suggested in a previous chapter , as well as more conscious filtering on
the front end, as you’re processing your input: “Is this really necessary or
useful for me to keep, or can I trust that I can access it from the Internet or
other sources if I need it?”
Incubate
There will probably be things in your in-tray about which you will say to
yourself, “There’ s nothing to do on this now , but there might be later .”
Examples of this would be:
An e-mail announcing a chamber of commerce breakfast with a guest
speaker you might want to hear , but it’ s two weeks away , and you’re not
sure yet if you’ll be at home then or out of town on a business trip.
An agenda for a board meeting you’ve been invited to attend in three
weeks. No action is required on it, other than your briefing yourself a day
ahead of the meeting by reading the agenda.
An advertisement for the next software upgrade for one of your favorite
applications. Do you really need this next version? Y ou don’ t know; you’d
rather sleep on it for another week.
An idea you had about something you might want to do for next year ’ s
annual sales meeting. There’ s nothing to do on this now , but you’d like to
be reminded when the time comes to start planning for it.
A note to yourself about taking a watercolor class, which you have zero
time for right now .
What do you do with these kinds of things? There are two options that
could work:
W rite them on a Someday/Maybe list.
Put a reminder of them on your calendar or in a tickler file.
It’ s fine to decide not to decide about something. Y ou just need a decide-
not-to-decide system to get it of f your mind.
The point of all of these incubation procedures is that they give you a way
to get the items of f your mind right now  and let you feel confident that
some reminder of the possible action will resurface at an appropriate time.
I’ll elaborate on these in more detail in the next chapter , on or ganizing. For
now , just put a Post-it on such items, and label them “maybe” or “remind on
October 17,” and set them aside in a Pending category you will be
accumulating for later sorting .*
Refer ence
Many of the things you will uncover in “in” will need no action but may
have value as potentially useful information about projects and topics.
Ideally , you have already set up a workable filing system (as described in
chapter 4) for your reference and support information. As you come across
material in your in-tray and that you e-mail (and attachments and W eb links
therein) that you’d like to keep for archival or support purposes, file it.
Y ou’ll probably discover that there are lots of miscellaneous kinds of things
that you want to keep but have piled up in stacks or stuf fed into drawers
because your reference system was too formal or just plain nonexistent. Let
me remind you here that a less-than- sixty-second, fun-to-use general-
reference filing system within reach of where you sit is a mission-critical
component of full implementation of this methodology . In the fast lane of
real life, if it’ s not easy , quick, and fun to file something away , you’ll stack
or simply accumulate it in
“in” instead of or ganizing. And then it will become much more dif ficult to
keep things processed.
Whenever you come across something you want to keep, make a label for
it, put it in a file folder , and tuck that into your filing drawer . Or put a Post-
it on it instructing your assistant to do the same. Or appropriately tag or
categorize it digitally . In my early days of coaching I used to give my
clients permission to keep a T o File pile. No longer . I discovered that if you
can’ t get it into your system immediately , you’re probably not ever going
to. If you won’ t do it now , you likely won’ t do it later , either .
For digital inputs that you want to keep for reference, a plethora of options
present themselves. If it’ s simply an e-mail that you want to keep so you
can retrieve it later , I suggest using the storage folders that are usually
available in e-mail applications—often in the navigator column on the side
of the user window .
Many people leave these nonactionable e-mails in their “in” section as a
sort of amorphous filing cabinet, which seriously clogs the system. Y ou
should feel free to instantly create a new reference file for a new topic,
theme, person, or project, and drag or insert the e-mail into it right away .
For documents, attachments, text, and graphics in e-mail that you might
want to keep, you will have to develop your own filing procedures. These
days there are very ef fective document storage applications in the cloud, as
well as note-making and or ganizing programs accessible from multiple
devices. The power , variety , and rapid evolvement of this enabling
technology belie a recommendation for any one universal best practice. It
behooves each of us to experiment, customize, and modify our digital
libraries for what works best. The key to keeping it ef fective will be regular
revisiting of our data and how we’re or ganizing it; and keeping it current
and usable.
Again, the key driver should be: Do I still have attention on my reference
content or system? If so, create a project and next action to unpack that, to
get this significant area for you on cruise control.
And If Ther e Is an Action . . . What Is It?
Doing a straightforwar d, clear -cut task that has a beginning and an end
balances out the  complexity-without-end that often vexes the r est of my life.
Sacr ed simplicity .
—Robert Fulghum
This is perhaps the most fundamental practice of this methodology . If
there’ s something that needs to be done about the item in “in,” then you
need to decide what, exactly , that next action is. “Next action,” again,
means the next physical, visible activity that would be required to move the
situation toward closure.
This is both easier and more dif ficult than it sounds.
The next action should  be easy to figure out, but there are often some quick
analyses and several planning steps that haven’ t occurred yet in your mind,
and these have to happen before you can determine precisely what has to
happen to complete the item, even if it’ s a fairly simple one.
Let’ s look at a sample list of the things that a person might typically have
his or her attention on.
Clean the garage
Do my taxes
Conference I’m going to
Bobby’ s birthday
Press release
Performance reviews
Management changes
Although each of these items may seem relatively clear as a task or project,
determining the next action on each one will take some thought.
Clean the garage
. . . W ell, I just have to get in ther e and start. No, wait a minute, ther e’ s a big
r efrigerator in ther e that I need to get rid of first. I should find out if John
Patrick wants it for his camp. I should . . .
Call John re: refrigerator in garage.
What about . . .
Do my taxes
. . . but I actually can’ t start on them until I have my last investment income
documents back. Can’ t do anything until then. So I’m . . .
W aiting for documents from Acme T rust
And for the . . .
Conference I’m going to
. . . I need to find out whether Sandra is going to pr epar e a pr ess kit for us. I
guess I need to . . .
E-mail Sandra re: press kits for the conference.
. . . and so forth. The action steps—“Call John,” “W aiting for documents,”
“E-mail Sandra”—are what need to be decided about everything that is
actionable in your in-tray .
The Action Step Needs to Be the Absolute Next Physical Thing to Do
Until you know what the next physical action is, there’ s still more thinking
required before anything can happen—before you’re appropriately engaged.
Remember that these are physical, visible activities. Many people think
they’ve determined the next action when they get it down to “set meeting.”
But that’ s not the next action, because it’ s not descriptive of physical
behavior . How do you set a meeting? W ell, it could be with a phone call or
an e-mail, but to whom?
Decide. If you don’ t decide now , you’ll still have to decide at some other
point, and what this process is designed to do is actually get you to finish
the thinking exercise about this item. If you haven’ t identified the next
physical action required to kick-start it, there will be a psychological gap
every time you think about it even vaguely . Y ou’ll tend to resist noticing it,
which leads to
procrastination.
When you get to a phone or to your computer , you want to have all your
thinking completed so you can use the tools you have and the location
you’re in to more easily get things done, having already defined what there
is to do.
Determine what physical activity needs to happen to get you to decide.
What if you say to yourself, “W ell, the next thing I need to do is decide
what to do about this”? That’ s a tricky one. Deciding isn’ t really an action,
because actions take time, and deciding doesn’ t. There’ s always some
physical activity that can be done to facilitate your decision making.
Ninety-nine percent of the time you just need more information before you
can make a decision. That additional information can come from external
sources (“Call Susan to get her input on the proposal”) or from internal
thinking (“Draft ideas about new reor ganization”). Either way , there’ s still a
next action to be determined in order to move the project forward.
Once Y ou Decide What the Action Step Is
Y ou have three options once you decide what the next action really is: Do it
(if the action takes less than two minutes).
Delegate it  (if you’re not the most appropriate person to do the action).
Defer it  into your or ganization system as an option for work to do later .
Do It
If the next action can be done in two minutes or less, do it when you first
pick the item up. If the e-mail requires just a thirty-second reading and then
a quick yes/no/other response back to the sender , do it now . If you can
browse the catalog in just a minute or two to see if there might be anything
of interest in it, browse away , and then toss it, route it, or reference it as
required. If the next action on something is to leave a quick message on
someone’ s voice mail, make the call now .
Even if the item is not a high-priority one, do it now if you’re ever going to
do it at all. The rationale for the two-minute rule is that it’ s more or less the
point where it starts taking longer to store and track an item than to deal
with it the first time it’ s in your hands—in other words, it’ s the ef ficiency
cutof f. If the thing’ s not important enough to be done, thr ow it away . If it is,
and if you’re going to do it sometime, the ef ficiency factor should come
into play .
Many people find that getting into the habit of following the two-minute
rule creates a dramatic improvement in their productivity . One vice
president of a lar ge software company told me that it gave him an additional
hour a day of quality discretionary time! He was one of those three-
hundred-e-mail-a-day high-tech executives, highly focused for most of the
workday on three key initiatives. Many of those e-mails were from people
who reported to him—and they needed his eyes on something, his
comments and OKs, in order to move forward. But because they were not
on a topic in his rifle sights, he would just stage the e-mails in “in,” to get to
“later .” After several thousand of them piled up, he would have to go in to
work and spend whole weekends trying to catch up. That would have been
OK if he were twenty-six, when everything’ s an adrenaline rush anyway ,
but he was in his thirties and had young kids. W orking all weekend was no
longer acceptable behavior . When I coached him he went through all eight-
hundred-plus e-mails he currently had in “in.” It turned out that a lot could
be dumped, quite a few needed to be filed as reference, and many others
required less-than-two-minute replies that he whipped through. I checked
with him a year later , and he was still current! He never let his e-mails
mount up beyond a screenful anymore. He said it had changed the nature of
his division because of the dramatic decrease in his own response time. His
staf f thought he was now made of T eflon!
The two-minute rule is magic.
That’ s a rather dramatic testimonial, but it’ s an indication of just how
critical some of these simple processing behaviors can be, especially as the
volume and speed of the input increase for you personally .
T wo minutes is in fact just a guideline. If you have a long open window of
time in which to process your in-tray , you can extend the cutof f for each
item to five or ten minutes. If you’ve got to get to the bottom of all your
input rapidly , in order to figure out how best to use your afternoon, then you
may want to shorten the time to one minute, or even thirty seconds, so you
can get through everything
a little faster .
Y ou’ll be surprised how many two-minute actions you can perform even on
your most critical projects.
It’ s not a bad idea to time yourself for a few of these while you’re becoming
familiar with the process. Most people I work with have dif ficulty
estimating how long two minutes actually is, and they greatly underestimate
how long certain actions are likely to take. For instance, if your action is to
leave someone a message, and you get the real person instead of his or her
voice-mail, the call will usually take quite a bit longer than two minutes.
The world can only be grasped by action, not by contemplation. The hand is
mor e important  than the eye. . . . The hand is the cutting edge of the mind.
—J. Br onowski
There’ s nothing you really need to track about your two-minute actions—
you just do them. If, however , you take an action and don’ t finish the
project with that one action, you’ll need to clarify what’ s next on it, and
manage that according to the same criteria. For instance, if you act to
replace a cartridge in your printer and discover that you’re now out of extra
cartridges, you’ll want to decide on the next action about getting them
(“Order printer cartridge refills online”) and do , delegate , or defer  it
appropriately .
Adhere to the two-minute rule and see how much you get done in the
process of clearing out your “in” stacks. Many people are amazed by how
many two-minute actions are possible, often on some of their most critical
current projects.
They are also delighted with applying this approach to small incompletions
that have been lying around and nagging at them much too long.
The two-minute rule has become a salvation for many in getting control of
their huge e-mail volume. In an active e-mail environment, it is likely that
at least 30 percent of your actionable e-mails will require less than two
minutes to respond and dispatch (assuming you have decent keyboard
skills). If you’re engaging with your e-mail, holding to this suggestion quite
significantly improves responsiveness and productivity in your ecosystem.
When I spend time
with someone cleaning up his or her e-mail inventory , invariably there are
dozens of quick actions generated that “move the needle” on multiple
fronts, unsticking significant backlog.
That said, you shouldn’ t become a slave to spending your day doing two-
minute actions. This rule should be applied primarily when you are
engaging with new input; for example, processing your in-tray , interacting
with someone in your of fice or home, or simply dealing with some random
intersection in the hallway . But if you don’ t do it when it shows up, and you
do still need to do it, you will have to take the time and ener gy to capture,
clarify , and track it, to prevent its encroachment into your head.
Delegate It
If the next action is going to take longer than two minutes, ask yourself,
“Am I the best person to be doing it?” If not, hand it of f to the appropriate
party , in a systematic format.
Delegation is not always downstream. Y ou may decide, “This has got to get
over to Customer Service,” or “My boss needs to put her eyes on this next,”
or “I need my partner ’ s point of view on this.”
A systematic format could be any of the following:
Send the appropriate party an e-mail.
W rite a note or an over -note on paper and route the item out to that person.
Send him or her a text or leave a voice mail.
Add it as an agenda item on a list for your next real-time conversation with
that person.
T alk to him or her directly , either face-to-face or by phone, text, or instant
message.
Although any of these options can work, I would (with some exceptions)
recommend them in the above order , top to bottom. E-mail is usually the
fastest mode in the system; it provides an electronic record; and the receiver
gets to deal with it at his or her convenience. W ritten notes are next because
they , too, can get into the system immediately , and the recipient then has a
physical particle to use as an or ganizational reminder . If you’re passing on
paper -based material as part of the handof f, a written communication is
obviously the way to go; as with e-mail, the person you hand it of f to can
then deal with it on his or her own
schedule. V oice mail and texting can be ef ficient, and many professionals
live by it; the downside is that tracking becomes an additional requirement
for both you and the recipient, what you say is not always what gets heard,
and texts are infamously cryptic. Next would be saving the communication
on an agenda list or in a folder for your next regular meeting with the
person. At times this is necessary because of the sensitive or detailed nature
of the topic, but it then must wait to get moving until that meeting occurs.
The least preferable option would be to interrupt what both you and the
person are doing in the moment to talk about the item. This is immediate,
but it hampers workflow for both of you and has the same downside as
voice mail: no written record.
T racking the Handoff If you do delegate an action to someone else, and if
you care at all whether something happens as a result, you’ll need to track
it. As I walk you through in the next chapter , about or ganizing, you’ll see
that a significant category to manage is W aiting For .
As you develop your own customized system, what you eventually hand of f
and then track could look like a list in a planner , a file folder holding
separate papers for each item, and/or a list categorized as W aiting For in
your software.
For now , if you don’ t have a trusted system set up already , just put a note on
a piece of paper—“W/F: reply from Bob”—and put that into a Pending
stack of notes in a separate pile or tray that may result from your
processing.
What If the Ball Is Alr eady in Someone Else’ s Court? In the example cited
previously about waiting for some documents to arrive so you can do your
taxes, the next action is currently on someone else’ s plate. In such situations
you will also want to track the action as a delegated item, or as a W aiting
For . On the paper that says “Do my taxes,” write something like “W aiting
for tax documents from Acme T rust” and put that into your Pending stack.
It’ s important that you record the date on everything that you hand of f to
others. This, of all the categories in your personal system, is the most
crucial one to keep tabs on. The few times you will actually want to refer to
that information (“But I called and ordered that on March 12”) will make it
worth establishing this as a lifelong habit.
Defer It
It’ s likely that most of the next actions you determine for things in “in” will
be
yours to do and will take longer than two minutes to complete. A call you
need to make to a customer; an e-mail to your team that you need to spend a
little time thinking about and drafting; a gift you need to buy for your
brother at the sporting goods store; a software application you need to
download from the W eb and try out; a conversation you must have with
your life partner about the school you’re thinking of sending your daughter
to—all of these fit that description.
These actions will have to be written down somewhere and then or ganized
in the appropriate categories so you can access them when you need to. For
the moment, go ahead and put Post-its on the pieces of paper in “in,” with
the action written on them, and add these to the Pending stack of papers that
have been processed.
The Pending Things That Ar e Left
If you follow the instructions in this chapter , you’ll dump a mess of things,
file a bunch, do a lot of two-minute actions, and hand of f a number of items
to other people. Y ou’ll also wind up with a stack of items that have actions
associated with them that you still need to do—soon, someday , or on a
specific date—and reminders of things you’re waiting on from other people.
This Pending group is made up of the actions you’ve delegated or deferred.
It is what still needs to be or ganized in some fashion in your personal
system, a topic I’ll cover in step-by-step detail in the next chapter .
Identifying the Pr ojects  Y ou Have
This last step in getting to the bottom of “in” requires a shift in perspective
from the single-action details to the lar ger picture—your projects.
Again, I define a project as any outcome you’re committed to achieving that
will take more than one action step to complete. If you look through an
inventory of actions that you have already been generating—“Call Frank
about the car alarm”; “E-mail Bernadette re: conference materials”—you’ll
no doubt recognize a number of things that are lar ger than the single action
you’ve defined. There’ s still going to be something to do about the car
alarm after the call to Frank, and there will still be something to handle
about the conference after the e-mail to Bernadette.
I hope you’re able to see the very practical reason for defining projects as
broadly as I do: if the action step you’ve identified will not complete the
commitment, then you’ll need some stake in the ground to keep reminding
you of actions you have pending until you have closure. Y ou need to make a
list of projects. A “Projects” list may include anything from “Give holiday
party” to
“Divest the software product line” to “Finalize compensation package.” The
purpose of this list is not to reflect your priorities but just to ensure that
you’ve got placeholders for all those open loops.
Right now you probably have between thirty and a hundred projects.
Whether you draw up your Projects list while you’re initially processing
your in-tray or after you’ve set up your action lists doesn’ t really matter . It
just needs to be done at some point, and it must be maintained, as it’ s the
key driver for reviewing where you are and where you want to be, and to
maintain a sense of week-to-week control of your life.
For now , let’ s make sure your or ganizing setup is “all systems go.”
