The Power of the Next-Action Decision
When a culture adopts “What’ s the next action?” as a standard operating
query , there’ s an automatic increase in ener gy , productivity , clarity , and
focus.
I HA VE A personal mission to make “What’ s the next action?” part of our
global thought process. I envision a world in which no meeting or discussion
will end, and no interaction cease, without a clear indication of whether or
not some action is needed—and if it is, what it will be, or at least who has
accountability for it. I envision or ganizations adopting a standard that
anything that lands in anyone’ s field of awareness will be evaluated for
action required, and the resulting decisions managed appropriately . Imagine
the freedom that would provide for people and or ganizations to focus their
attention on bigger issues and opportunities.
Over the years I have noticed an extraordinary shift in ener gy and
productivity whenever individuals and groups installed “What’ s the next
action?” as a fundamental and consistently asked question. As simple as the
query seems, it is still somewhat rare to find it fully operational where it
needs to be.
One of the greatest challenges you may encounter is that once you have
gotten used to “What’ s the next action?” for yourself and those around you,
interacting with people who aren’ t asking it can be highly frustrating. It
clarifies things so quickly that dealing with people and environments that
don’ t use it can seem nightmarish.
W e are all accountable for defining what, if anything, we are committed to
make happen as we engage with others and ourselves. And at some point, for
any outcome that we have an internal commitment to complete, we must
make the decision about the next physical action required. There’ s a great
dif ference,
however , between making that decision when things show  up and doing it
when they blow  up.
The Source of the T echnique
Doing a straightforwar d, clear -cut task that has a beginning and an end
balances out the  complexity-without-end that often vexes the r est of my life.
Sacr ed simplicity .
—Robert Fulghum
I learned this simple but extraordinary next-action technique more than thirty
years ago from a longtime friend and management-consultant mentor of
mine, Dean Acheson (no relation to the former U.S. Secretary of State).
Dean had spent many prior years consulting with executives and researching
what was required to free up the logjams many of them had regarding
projects and situations they were involved in, in order to release and
galvanize ener gy for significant change required in their or ganizations. One
day he just started picking up each individual piece of paper on an
executive’ s desk and forcing him to decide what the very next thing was that
he had to do to move it forward.
The results were so immediate and so profound for the executive that Dean
continued for years to perfect a methodology using that same question to
process the in-tray . Since then, given what I’ve developed using Dean’ s
insights, hundreds of thousands of people have been trained and coached
with this key concept, and it remains a foolproof technique.
This thought process is not something we are born doing, nor does it seem to
come to us naturally . When you were born, it probably didn’ t occur to you to
ask your mother , “So, what are we doing here, and what’ s the next action,
and who has it?” It is a learned technique of thinking, decision making, and
consciously directed focus. It will happen automatically for you when the
situation obviously demands it, as in a crisis, or when the pressure in a
situation (from the boss, a client, your child, or the unexpected
circumstance) forces a next-action decision to avert painful consequences.
But incorporating this as a proactive behavior , before the circumstances are
so obvious and actions so immediately necessary , is an acquired practice .*
Making it a part of your personal and or ganizational life never fails to
improve both your productivity and peace of mind.
Creating the Option of Doing
How could something so simple be so powerful—“What’ s the next action?”
T o help answer that question, I invite you to revisit for a moment your mind-
sweep list (see page  1 15) —or at least to think about all the projects that are
probably sitting around in your head. Do you have a sense that any of them
haven’ t been moving along as consistently and productively as they could
be?
Y ou’ll probably admit that yes, indeed, a few have been a little bit stuck.
If you haven’ t known for sure whether you needed to make a call, send an e-
mail, talk to someone, surf the W eb about something, or buy an item at the
store as the very next thing to move on, it hasn’ t been getting done. What’ s
ironic is that it would likely require only about ten seconds of thinking to
figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list.
But it’ s ten seconds of thinking and decision making that most people
haven’ t done about most things on their lists.
For example, someone will have something like “tires” on a list.
I then ask, “What’ s that about?”
He responds, “W ell, I need new tires on my car .”
“So what’ s the next action?”
At that point he usually wrinkles up his forehead, ponders for a few
moments, and expresses his conclusion: “W ell, I need to check the W eb for
stores and prices for the tires.”
That’ s about how much time and cognitive investment is required to decide
what the “doing” would look like on almost everything. It’ s just the few
seconds of focused thinking that most people have not yet done about most
of their still unfinished stuf f.
The secr et of getting ahead is getting started. The secr et of getting started is
br eaking your  complex overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks,
and then starting on the first one.
—Mark T wain
It will probably be true, too, that the person who needs tires on his car has
had that on his radar for quite a while. It’ s also likely that he’ s been on his
computer hundreds of times, often with just enough time and ener gy to take
that action. Why didn’ t he do it? Because in that state of mind, the last thing
in the world he felt like doing was considering all his projects, including
getting tires,
and what their next actions were. In those moments he didn’ t feel like
thinking at all.
What he needed was to have already figured those things out. If he gets that
next-action thinking done, then when he happens to have fifteen minutes
before a meeting, at his computer , and his ener gy is about 4.2 out of 10, he
can look at the list of things to do and be delighted to see “Research new
tires” on it. “That’ s something I can do and complete successfully!” he’ll
think, and then he’ll actually be motivated to surf the W eb about it, just to
experience the “win” of completing something useful in the time and ener gy
window he’ s in. In this context he’d be incapable of starting a lar ge proposal
draft for a client, but he has suf ficient resources for searching the Internet
and getting simple information quickly . It’ s highly probable that at some
point he’ll look at a new set of tires on his car and feel on top of the world.
Defining what real doing looks like on the most basic level and or ganizing
placeholder reminders that we can trust are master keys to productivity
enhancement and creating a relaxed inner environment.
W ithout a next action, there remains a potentially infinite gap between
current reality and what you need to do.
Often even the simplest things are stuck because we haven’ t made a final
decision yet about the next action. People in my seminars often have things
on their lists like “Get a tune-up for the car .” Is “Get a tune-up” a next
action? Not unless you’re walking out to your car with wrench in hand,
dressed to get greasy .
“So, what’ s the next action?”
“Uh, I need to take the car to the garage. Oh, yeah, I need to find out if the
garage can take it. I guess I need to call the garage and make the
appointment.”
“Do you have the number?”
“Darn, no . . . I don’ t have the name and number for the garage. Fred
recommended that garage to me, and I don’ t have that information. I knew
something was missing in the equation.”
And that’ s often what happens with so many things for so many people. W e
glance at the project, and some part of us thinks, “I don’ t quite have all the
pieces between here and there.” W e know something is missing, but we’re
not sure what it is, so we quit.
“So, what’ s the next action?”
“I need to get the name and phone number . I guess I could get it from Fred.”
“How could you do that?”
“I can e-mail Fred!”
So the next action really is “E-mail Fred for info re: the garage.”
Did you notice how many steps had to be tracked back before we got to the
real next action on this project? That’ s typical. Most people have many
things just like that on their lists and on their minds.
Why Bright People Procrastinate the Most
It’ s really the smartest and most sensitive people who have the highest
number of undecided things in their lives and on their lists. Why is that?
Think of how our bodies respond to the images we hold in our minds. It
appears that the nervous system can’ t tell the dif ference between a well-
imagined thought and reality .
Bright people have the capability of freaking out faster and more
dramatically than anyone else.
T o prove this to yourself, picture walking into a food market and
approaching the brightly lit fruit-and-vegetable section. Are you there? OK,
now go to the citrus bins—oranges, grapefruits, lemons. Now see the big
pile of yellow lemons. There’ s a cutting board and a knife next to them. T ake
one of those big yellow lemons and cut it in half lengthwise. Smell that
citrus smell! It’ s really juicy , and there’ s lemon juice trickling onto the
board. Now take a half lemon and cut that  in half, so you have a quarter
lemon wedge in your hands. OK, now
—remember how you did this as a kid?—put that quarter of a lemon in your
mouth and bite into it! Scrunch!
If you played along with me, you probably noticed that the saliva content in
your mouth increased at least a bit. Y our body was actually trying to process
citric acid! And it was just in your mind. If your body responds to the
pictures you give it, how are you likely to feel physically when you think
about, say , doing your taxes? Are you sending yourself easy , let’ s go,
completion, success, and “I’m a winner!” pictures? Probably not. For just
that reason, what kinds of people would logically be the most resistant to
being reminded about a project
like that—that is, who would procrastinate the most? Of course, it would be
the most creative, sensitive, and intelligent people—because their sensitivity
and creativity give them the capability to produce in their minds lurid
nightmare scenarios about what might be involved in doing the project, and
all the negative consequences that might occur if it isn’ t done perfectly!
They just freak out in an instant and quit!
I am an old man, and I have known a gr eat many tr oubles, but most of them
never happened.
—Mark T wain
Who doesn’ t procrastinate? Often it’ s the insensitive oafs who just take
something and start plodding forward, unaware of all the things that could
go wrong. Everyone else tends to get hung up about all kinds of things.
Do my taxes? Oh, no! It’ s not going to be that easy . It’ s going to be dif ferent
this year , I’m sure. I saw the forms—they look dif ferent. There are probably
new rules I’m going to have to figure out. I might have to read all that damn
material.
Long form, short form, medium form. File together with my partner? File
separate? W e’ll probably want to claim some new deductions, but if we do
we’ll have to back them up, and that means we’ll need all the receipts. Oh,
my God—I don’ t know if we really have all the receipts we’ll need, and
what if we didn’ t have all the receipts but we claimed the deductions anyway
and we got audited?
Audited? Oh, no—tax fraud! Jail!
And so a lot of people psychologically put themselves in jail, just glancing at
their tax forms—because they’re so smart, sensitive, and creative. In my
many years of coaching individuals, this pattern has been borne out more
times than I can count—usually it’ s the brightest and most sophisticated
folks who have the most stuck piles in their of fices, homes, e-mail, and
heads. Most of the executives I work with have at least several big, complex,
and amorphous projects stacked either on top of a file cabinet or on a mental
shelf. There always seem to be hobgoblin thoughts lurking inside them—“If
we don’ t look at or think about the projects, maybe they’ll stay quiet!”
Ceasing negative imaging will always cause your ener gy to increase.
So what’ s the solution? There’ s always having a drink. Numb it. Dumb it
down. Notice what happens to many people when they get a little alcohol in
their brain. It should drop their ener gy immediately , because it’ s a
depressant; often, though, the ener gy lifts, at least initially . Why? The
alcohol is depressing something—it’ s shutting down the negative self-talk
and uncomfortable visions that are going on in these folks’ minds. Of course
my ener gy will increase if I stop depressing myself with overwhelming
pictures of not handling something successfully . But the numbing solutions
are temporary at best. The stuf f doesn’ t go away . And unfortunately , when
we numb ourselves, we can’ t do it selectively
—the source of inspiration and enthusiasm and personal ener gy also seems
to get numbed.
Intelligent Dumbing Down
No matter how big and tough a pr oblem may be, get rid of confusion by
taking one little step  towar d solution. Do something.
—Geor ge F . Nor denholt
There is another solution: intelligently dumbing down your brain by figuring
out the next action. Y ou’ll invariably feel a relieving of pressure about
anything you have a commitment to change or do, when you decide on the
very next physical action required to move it forward. Nothing, essentially ,
will change in the world. But shifting your focus to something that your
mind perceives as a doable task will create a real increase in positive ener gy ,
direction, and motivation. If you have truly captured all the things that have
your attention during the mind sweep, go through the list again now and
decide on the single very next action to take on every one of them. Notice
what happens to your ener gy .
Everything on your lists and in your stacks is either attractive or repulsive to
you—there’ s no neutral ground when it comes to your stuf f.
Y ou are either attracted or repelled by the things on your lists; there isn’ t any
neutral territory . Y ou are either positively drawn toward completing the
action or
reluctant to think about what it is and resistant to getting involved in it.
Often it’ s simply the next-action decision that makes the dif ference between
the two extremes. Thinking and deciding require ener gy . And when you
notice something unfinished in your world but haven’ t determined what the
next action is yet, you’ll tend to be reminded of your fatigue and sense of
being overwhelmed! Hence most people’ s reaction to their own lists and
or ganizers is negative—not because of the contents per se, but rather
because suf ficient appropriate thinking has yet to be applied to them.
In following up with people who have begun to implement this
methodology , I’ve discovered that one of the subtler ways many of them fall
of f the wagon is in letting their action lists grow back into lists of tasks or
subprojects instead of discrete next actions. They’re still ahead of most
people because they’re actually writing things down, but they often find
themselves stuck, and procrastinating, because they’ve allowed their action
lists to harbor items like:
“Meeting with the banquet committee”
“Johnny’ s birthday”
“Receptionist”
“Slide presentation”
Y ou can only cur e r etail but you can pr event wholesale.
—Br ock Chisholm
In other words, things have morphed back into “stuf f” instead of starting at
the action level. There are no clear next actions here, and anyone keeping a
list filled with items like this would send her brain into overload every time
she looked at it.
Is this extra work? Is figuring out the next action on your commitments
additional ef fort that you don’ t need to expend? No, of course not. If you
need to get your car tuned, for instance, you’re going to have to figure out
that next action at some point anyway . The problem is that most people wait
to do it until the next action is “Call the Auto Club for tow truck!”
So when do you think most people really make a lot of their next-action
decisions about their stuf f—when it shows up, or when it blows up? And do
you think there might be a dif ference in the quality of their lives if they
handled this knowledge work on the front end instead of the back? Which do
you think is the
more ef ficient way to move through life—deciding next actions on your
projects as soon as they appear on your radar screen and then ef ficiently
grouping them into categories of actions that you get done in certain uniform
contexts, or avoiding thinking about what, exactly , needs to be done until it
has  to be done, then sputtering through your actions as you try to catch up
and put out the fires?
A voiding action decisions until the pressure of the last minute creates huge
inef ficiencies and unnecessary stress.
That may sound exaggerated, but when I ask groups of people to estimate
when most of the action decisions are made in their companies, with few
exceptions they say , “When things blow up.” One of our global corporate
clients surveyed its population about sources of stress in its culture, and the
number one complaint was the last-minute crisis work consistently promoted
by team leaders who failed to make appropriate decisions on the front end.
The V alue of a Next-Action Decision-Making Standard
I have had several sophisticated senior executives tell me that installing
“What’ s the next action?” as an operational standard in their or ganization
was transformative in terms of measurable performance output. It changed
their culture permanently and significantly for the better .
Why? Because the question forces clarity , accountability , productivity , and
empowerment.
Clarity
T oo many discussions end with only a vague sense that people know what
they have decided and are going to do. But without a clear conclusion that
there is  a next action, much less what it is and who’ s got it, more often than
not a lot of stuf f gets left up in the air .
I am frequently asked to facilitate meetings. I’ve learned the hard way that
no matter where we are in the conversation, twenty minutes before the
agreed end time of the discussion I must force the question: “So what’ s the
next action here?” In my experience, there is usually twenty minutes’ worth
of clarifying
(and sometimes tough decisions) still required to come up with an answer .
T alk does not cook rice.
—Chinese pr overb
This is radical common sense—radical because it often compels discussion
at deeper levels than people are comfortable with. “Are we serious about
this?”
“Do we really know what we’re doing here?” “Are we really ready to
allocate precious time and resources to this?” It’ s very easy to avoid these
more relevant levels of thinking. What prevents those issues from slipping
away into amorphous stuf f is forcing the decision about the next action.
Some further conversation, exploration, deliberation, and negotiation are
often needed to put the topic to rest. The world is too unpredictable these
days to permit assumptions about outcomes: we need to take responsibility
for moving things to clarity .
Y ou have to have some experience of this to really know what I mean here.
If you do, you’re probably saying to yourself, “Y es!” If you’re not sure what
I’m talking about, I suggest that in your next meeting with anyone, you end
the conversation with the question, “So what’ s the next action here?” Then
notice what happens.
Accountability
The dark side of collaborative cultures is the aller gy they foster to holding
anyone responsible for having the ball. “Mine or yours?” is unfortunately not
in the common vocabulary of many such or ganizations. There is a sense that
that would be impolite. “W e’re all in this together” is a worthy sentiment,
but seldom a reality in the hard-nosed day-to-day world of work. T oo many
meetings end with a vague feeling among the players that something ought
to happen, and the hope that it’ s not their personal job to make it so.
The way I see it, what’ s truly impolite is allowing people to walk away from
discussions unclear . Real togetherness of a group is reflected by the
responsibility that all take for defining the real things to do and the specific
people assigned to do them, so everyone is freed of the angst of still-
undecided actions.
Again, if you’ve been there, you’ll know what I’m talking about. If you
haven’ t, test it out—take a small risk and ask, “So what’ s the next action on
this?” at the end of each discussion point in your next staf f meeting, or in
your next family conversation around the dinner table.
Pr oductivity
Ther e ar e risks and costs to a pr ogram of action, but they ar e far less than
the long-range risks  and costs of comfortable inaction.
—John F . Kennedy
Or ganizations naturally become more productive when they model and train
front-end next-action decision making. For all the reasons mentioned,
determining the required physical allocation of resources necessary to make
something happen as soon as the outcome has been clarified will produce
more results sooner , and with less ef fort.
Productivity will improve only when individuals increase their operational
responsiveness. And in knowledge work, that means clarifying actions on
the front end instead of the back.
Learning to break through the barriers of the sophisticated creative thinking
that can freeze activity—that is, the entangled mental webs we spin—is a
superior skill. “Productivity” has been touted for decades as a desirable thing
to improve in or ganizations. Anything that can help maximize output will do
that.
But in the world of knowledge work, all the computers and telecom
improvements and leadership seminars on the planet will make no dif ference
in this regard unless the individuals involved increase their operational
responsiveness. And that requires thinking about something that lands in
your world befor e  you have to .*
Empowerment
Perhaps the greatest benefit of adopting the next-action approach is that it
dramatically increases your ability to make things happen, with a
concomitant rise in your self-esteem and constructive outlook.
Start by doing what’ s necessary , then what’ s possible, and suddenly you ar e
doing the  impossible.
—Saint Francis of Assisi
People are constantly doing things, but usually only when they have to,
under fire from themselves or others. They get no sense of winning, or of
being in control, or of cooperating among themselves and with their world.
People are starving for those experiences.
The daily behaviors that define the things that are incomplete and the moves
that are needed to complete them must change. Getting things going of your
own accord, before you’re forced to by external pressure and internal stress,
builds a firm foundation of self-worth that will spread to every aspect of
your life. Y ou are the captain of your own ship; the more you act from that
perspective, the better things will go for you.
Asking yourself, “What’ s the next action?” undermines the victim mentality .
It presupposes that there is a possibility of change, and that there is
something you can do to make it happen. That is the assumed af firmation in
the behavior .
And these kinds of assumed af firmations often work more fundamentally to
build a positive self-image than can repeating, “I am a powerful, ef fective
person, making things happen in my life!” a thousand times.
People ar e always blaming their cir cumstances for what they ar e. I don’ t
believe in  cir cumstances. The people who get on in this world ar e the people
who get up and look for the  cir cumstances they want, and, if they can’ t find
them, make them.
—Geor ge Bernar d Shaw
Is there too much complaining in your culture? The next time someone
moans about something, try asking, “So what’ s the next action?” People will
complain only about something that they assume could be better than it
currently is. The action question forces the issue. If it can be changed, there’ s
some action
that will change it. If it can’ t, it must be considered part of the landscape to
be incorporated in strategy and tactics. Complaining is a sign that someone
isn’ t willing to risk moving on a changeable situation, or won’ t consider the
immutable circumstance in his or her plans. This is a temporary and hollow
form of self-validation.
Although my colleagues and I rarely promote our work in this way , I notice
people really empowering themselves every day as we coach them in
applying the next-action technique. It increases the light in their eyes and the
lightness in their step, and a sparkle shows up in their thinking and
demeanor . W e are all already powerful, but deciding on and ef fectively
managing the physical actions required to move things forward seems to
exercise that power in ways that call forward the more positive aspects of
our nature.
When you start to make things happen, you begin to believe that you can
make things happen. And that  makes things happen.
