Getting Projects Under Control
CHAPTERS 4 THROUGH 9 have given you all the tricks and methods
you need to clear your head and make intuitive choices about what to do
when. That’ s the horizontal level—what needs your attention and action
across the horizontal landscape of your life. The last piece of the puzzle is
the vertical level—the digging deep and pie-in-the-sky thinking that can
leverage your creative brainpower . Y ou may indeed have clarified outcomes
and next-action steps for the various projects and situations in which you’re
involved, but there are times when you will feel called to enhance your
relationship with some of them with more creative thinking and detailed
how-to development.
That gets us back to refining and ener gizing our project planning.
The Need for More Informal Planning
The middle of every successful pr oject looks like a disaster .
—Rosabeth Moss Kanter
After years of working with thousands of professionals down in the trenches,
I can safely say that virtually all of us could be doing more planning, more
informally and more often, of our projects and our lives. And if we did, it
would relieve a lot of pressure on our psyches and produce an enormous
amount of creative output with minimal ef fort.
I’ve discovered that the biggest improvement opportunity in planning does
not consist of techniques for the highly elaborate and complex kinds of
project
or ganizing that professional project managers sometimes use (like Gantt
charts).
Most of the people who need those already have them, or at least have
access to the training and software required to learn about them. The real
need is to capture and utilize more of the creative, proactive thinking we do
—or could  do.
Y ou need to set up systems and tricks that get you to think about your
projects and situations more frequently , more easily , and more in depth.
The major reason for the lack of this kind of ef fective value-added thinking
is the dearth of easily structured and usable systems for managing the
potentially infinite amount of detail that could show up as a result. That is
why my approach tends to be bottom-up. If you feel out of control with your
current actionable commitments, you’ll resist focused planning; an
unconscious pushback occurs.
As you begin to apply these methods, however , you may find that they free
up room for enormous creative and constructive thinking. If you have
systems and habits ready to leverage your ideas, your productivity can
expand exponentially .
In chapter 3, I covered in some detail the five phases of project planning that
take something from the idea stage into physical reality .
What follows is a compilation of practical tips and techniques to facilitate
the natural, informal planning processes I recommend. Although these
suggestions are all based on common sense, they’re not followed by most
people nearly as frequently as they could be. Put them to use whenever and
as often as you can, instead of saving up your thinking for big formal
meetings.
What Projects Should Y ou Be Planning?
Most of the outcomes you have identified for your Projects list will not need
any kind of front-end planning, other than the sort you do in your head,
quickly and naturally , to come up with a next action on them. The only
planning needed for
“Get car inspected,” for example, would be to decide to check the Internet
for the nearest inspection location and set up a time.
There are two types of projects, however , that deserve at least some sort of
planning activity: (1) those that still have your attention even after you’ve
determined their next actions, and (2) those about which potentially useful
ideas and supportive detail just show up ad hoc.
The first type—the projects that you know have other things about them that
must be decided on and or ganized—will need a more detailed approach than
just identifying a next action. For these you’ll need a more specific
application of one or more of the other four phases of the natural planning
model: purpose and principles, vision/outcome, brainstorming, and/or
or ganizing.
The second type—the projects for which ideas just show up, ad hoc, when
you’re on a beach or in a car or in a meeting—need to have an appropriate
place into which these associated ideas can be captured. Then they can
reside there for later use as needed.
Pr ojects That Need Next Actions About Planning
There are probably a few projects you can think of right now , of f the top of
your head, that you know you want to get more objectified, fleshed out, and
under control. Perhaps you have an important meeting coming up and you
know you have to prepare an agenda and materials for it. Or you’ve just
inherited the job of coordinating the annual associates’ conference, and
you’ve got to get it or ganized as soon as possible so you can start delegating
significant pieces. Or you need to think about and handle plans for an
upcoming holiday with your family . If you haven’ t done it already , get a next
action now  that will start the planning process for each of these, and put it on
the appropriate action list. Then proceed with further planning steps.
T ypical Planning Steps
The most common types of planning-oriented actions will be your own
brainstorming and or ganizing, setting up meetings, and gathering
information.
Brainstorming Some of the projects that have your attention right now will
require you to do your own free-form thinking; this is especially true of
those for which you were not clear about what the next action would be
when you made that decision. These should all have a next action, such as
“Draft ideas re X.”
Y ou need to decide where and how you want to do that action, in order to
know which action list to put it on. Do you do this kind of thinking best on a
computer , or by handwriting your thoughts on paper? I may choose either
medium, depending on what my intuition tells me. For me this next action
would
go either on my “At Computer” list or on “Anywhere” (because I can draw
mind maps or take rough notes wherever I am, as long as I have pen and
paper).
Or ganizing Y ou may have some projects for which you have already
collected notes and miscellaneous support materials, and you just need to
sort through them and get them into a more structured form. In this case,
your next action would likely be “Or ganize Project X notes.” If you have to
be in your of fice to do that (because that’ s where the files are, and you don’ t
want to carry them around), that action should go on your “At Of fice” action
list. If you’re carrying the project notes around with you in a folder , or in
some digital device, then the
“Or ganize . . .” action would go on an “Anywhere” action list if you’re
going to do it by hand, or on “At Computer” if you’re going to use a word
processing or outlining program, or presentation, mind-mapping, or project-
planning software.
One of the greatest blocks to or ganizational (and family) productivity is the
lack of decision by someone about the need for a meeting, and with whom,
to move something forward.
Setting Up Meetings Often the next progress to be made on project thinking
is to set up a meeting with the people you’d like to have involved in the
brainstorming and/or decision making. That usually means sending an e-mail
to the whole group or to an assistant to get it calendared, or making a phone
call to the primary person to nail down a day and time.
Gathering Information Sometimes the next task on project thinking is to
gather more data. Maybe you need to talk to someone to get his or her input
(“Call Bill re his thoughts on the managers’ meeting”). Or you need to look
through the files you just inherited from last year ’ s conference (“Review
Associate Conference archive files”). Or you want to surf the W eb to get a
sense of what’ s happening “out there” on a new topic you’re exploring
(“Look into college scholarship funds”).
Random Pr oject Thinking
Don’ t lose any ideas about projects that could potentially be useful. Many
times you’ll think of something you don’ t want to for get when you’re in a
place that
has nothing to do with the project. Y ou’re driving to the store, for example,
and you think of a great way to start of f the next staf f meeting. Or you’re
stirring the spaghetti sauce in the kitchen and it occurs to you that you might
want to give out nice tote bags to participants in the upcoming conference.
Or you’re watching the evening news when you suddenly remember another
key person you may want to include in the advisory council you’re putting
together .
If these aren’ t specifically next actions that can go directly on your action
lists, you’ll still need to capture and or ganize them somewhere that makes
sense.
Of course, the most critical tool for ensuring that nothing gets lost is your
collection system—your in-tray , pen and paper , or smartphone. Y ou need to
hold all your ideas until you later decide what to do with them.
T ools and Structures That Support Project Thinking
No matter at what level project ideas show up, it’ s great to have good tools
always close at hand for capturing them as they occur . Once they’ve been
captured, it’ s useful to have access to them whenever you need to refer to
them.
Thinking T ools
Luck affects everything. Let your hook always be cast; in the str eam wher e
you least expect it  ther e will be fish.
—Ovid
One of the great secrets to getting ideas and increasing your productivity is
utilizing the function-follows-form phenomenon—great tools can trigger
good thinking. (I’ve come up with some of my most productive thoughts
when simply exploring a new software application that created an interesting
or fun way to generate and capture data.)
If you aren’ t writing anything down, or inputting into a digital device, it’ s
extremely dif ficult to stay focused on anything for more than a few minutes,
especially if you’re by yourself. But when you utilize physical tools to keep
your thinking anchored and saved, you can stay engaged constructively for
hours.
W riting Instruments
Function often follows form. Give yourself a context for capturing thoughts,
and thoughts will occur that you don’ t yet know you have.
Keep good writing tools around all the time so you never have any
unconscious resistance to thinking due to not having anything to capture it
with. If I don’ t have something to write with or text or type into, I know I’m
not as comfortable letting myself think progressively about projects and
situations.
Conversely , I have done some great thinking and planning at times just
because I wanted to use my great-feeling, smooth-writing fountain or gel
pen!
Y ou may not be inspired by cool gear like I am, but if you are, do yourself a
favor and invest in quality writing tools.
I also suggest that you keep nice pens at each of the stations where you’re
likely to want to take notes—at your desk(s), in the kitchen, in your
briefcases, satchels, purses, and backpacks.
Paper and Pads
Where is your closest writing pad? Keep it closer .
In addition to writing tools, you should always have their functional
equivalent
—pads of paper—close at hand. Perforated paper is preferable to solid
notebooks, because you want to be able to tear of f pages with ideas and
notes and toss them into your in-tray until you get a chance to process them.
Also, you may find it valuable to keep some of your early and informal
jotted mind maps and notes (original or scanned) in appropriate files. The
handwritten trails often contain rich context memory jogs that prove
valuable later on.
Easels and Whiteboards
How do I know what I think, until I hear what I say?
—E. M. Forster
If you have room for them, whiteboards and/or easel pads are very
functional thinking tools to use from time to time. They give you plenty of
space on which to jot down ideas, and it can be useful to keep them up in
front of you for a while, as you incubate on a topic. Whiteboards are great to
have on a wall in your of fice and in meeting rooms, and the bigger the better .
Some companies have designed whole internal walls as erasable writing
surfaces, fostering brainstorming and ad hoc visual communications. If you
have children, I recommend that you install one in their bedrooms (I wish I
had grown up with the encouragement to have as many ideas as I could!). Be
sure to keep plenty of fresh markers on hand—nothing stifles creative
thinking faster than dry and useless writing tools.
Whenever two or more people are gathered for a meeting, someone should
start writing somewhere where the other(s) can see. Even if you erase the
thoughts after a few minutes, just the act of writing them down facilitates a
constructive thinking process like nothing else. (I’ve found it immensely
helpful at times to draw informal diagrams and notes on paper tablecloths,
place mats, or even napkins in restaurants, if I didn’ t have my own pad of
paper at hand.) Thinking in Y our Digital T ools
Many times I like to think on my laptop (and, less frequently , on my tablet),
within my word processing, mind-mapping, outlining, presentation, or
spreadsheet programs. There are so many things I might want to do later on
with my thinking, and it feels terrific to already have it in some digital form
for later editing, and cutting and pasting into various other applications.
Once I’ve booted up and the screen is ready in front of me, I find that
thinking just automatically starts to happen. This is another good reason to
ensure that your typing and keyboard skills are suf ficient to make engaging
with the computer at least easy , if not downright fun.
Just as lar ger whiteboards facilitate more creative connections and expanded
thought horizons, I have found that lar ger and additional computer screens
provide a similar usefulness. As the world has rapidly become both digital
and mobile, people have understandably experienced a tremendous increase
in access and ef ficiency with their ever -smaller devices. I suggest, however ,
that the value of smartphones and the like is for the execution of the r esults
of thinking—not
for generating creative thought .* For that I want mor e  space, not less.
The Support Structur es
In addition to good tools ubiquitously at hand, it is productive to have
accessible formats into which project thinking can be captured. Much as a
good pen and paper in front of you support brainstorming, having good tools
and places for or ganizing project details facilitates the more linear planning
that many projects need.
Cr eate File Folders or Loose-Leaf Pages as Needed
If you don’ t have a good system for storing bad ideas, you probably don’ t
have one for filing good ones, either .
A good general-reference filing system, right at hand and easy to use, is not
only critical to manage the general workflow process, but highly functional
for project thinking as well. Often a project begins to emer ge when it’ s
triggered by relevant data, notes, and miscellaneous materials, and for this
reason, you’ll want to create a folder for a topic as soon as you have
something to put in it. If your filing system is too formal (or nonexistent),
you’ll probably miss many opportunities to generate a project focus
suf ficiently early . As soon as you return from that first meeting with your
initial notes about a topic that has just emer ged on the horizon, create a file
and store them in it right away (after you have gleaned any next actions, of
course).
Many times, while coaching clients, I find that the mere act of creating a file
for a topic into which we can or ganize random notes and potentially relevant
materials gives them a significantly improved sense of control. It’ s a way of
physically , visibly , and psychologically getting their “arms around it.”
If you like to work with a loose-leaf notebook or planner , it’ s good to keep
an inventory of fresh notepaper or graph paper that you can use to set up a
page on a theme or project as it shows up. While some projects may later
deserve a whole tabbed section or even an entire notebook of their own, they
don’ t start out that way . And most of your projects may need only a page or
two to hold the few ideas you need to track.
Paper V ersus Digital
For those who have become increasingly digitally oriented, it is tempting to
try to eliminate paper altogether . Theoretically that shouldn’ t be a problem,
with all the digital note-taking, scanning, and character -recognition tools
available. In practice, however , paper still provides high value for most of
us. Handwritten note taking is not going away , for multiple reasons, not the
least of which is the universality of the tools and the range of graphic
representations available. W e tend to think dif ferently when we express with
dif ferent equipment, and many people find that writing and drawing by hand
unwraps a broader palette of ideas.
Also, paper -based materials allow us to be reminded of information,
relationships, and perspectives more readily than what we can see at any one
time on a computer screen. I personally know of many digitally savvy
people who have returned to using paper planners and notebooks because
they found them easier to use to coordinate their own thinking and
reminders. Many times I will print documents related to a person, project, or
topic, which I then hold in a physical file folder to use in a meeting or for my
own writing and research.
Though much of that paper will be recycled and the updated information
returned to a digital home, the physical materials in the interim serve a
function of which the computer by itself is still incapable.
Digital technology will undoubtedly continue to emer ge, which will
contribute vastly to thinking, planning, and decision support in ways that
low-tech materials and tools cannot. But until pens, notepads, Post-its,
physical folders, and printed documents can be replaced by something better ,
they will still need to play some part in your coordinated personal
management system. *
Softwar e T ools
I have yet to discover any one perfect project-management tool. The plethora
of applications that purport to serve that function are usually either too high-
powered or too simplistic for what most of us need to manage. And as I’ve
noted, I have never seen any two projects that needed the same amount of
detailing and structure to get them under control. So it would be dif ficult to
create any one application that would suf fice for the majority . The rest of us
usually find bits and pieces of applications more informal and project-
friendly .
That said, there are multiple kinds of digital tools that can be extremely
useful. Most professionals are familiar with word processing programs,
spreadsheets, and presentation programs, any of which might be the optimal
way to structure project plans or portions thereof, especially once the
purpose, vision, and brainstorming phases have been handled.
The two types of software that tend to be more useful for informal planning
and brainstorming are mind-mapping and outlining applications. I personally
use a digital mind-mapping tool for most all of my projects as a way both to
do focused brainstorming and to capture random thoughts about the projects
as they show up ad hoc. In most cases the final mind map itself is suf ficient
or ganization for me to feel comfortable that I have the project under control.
Another option for brainstorming is an outlining program, which allows the
creation of headings and subheadings, in limited or expanded detail. Most
good word processing programs also provide this functionality . The nice
thing about these programs is that they can handle a wide range of
complexity—from the simplest few bullet points about or ganizing a party to
generating the structure for a whole book you’re writing. Though outlining
and word processing programs tend to support more structured thinking,
because of the ease of cutting, pasting, and rearranging text in the digital
world, they still allow for plenty of creative thought development.

DIGIT AL OUTLINING
On the high end of the spectrum is complex project-management software.
Professionals and or ganizations that have very specific needs for which the
rigor and details managed by those applications are required usually have
and use these tools already , in order to function. And they are most often
customized for company-specific projects. This is the software that is used to
launch Mars probes, coordinate building construction, and deliver airplanes
and pharmaceuticals.
On the lowest end of the digital project-management scale is jotting ideas in
the Notes section of a T ask item that lists one of your projects, or using
generic note-generating and or ganizing software, creating a note for a project
with its associated thoughts.
If you are computer savvy , you will no doubt use several of these modalities
for developing and capturing project plans and collateral material. Make sure
you create comfort with the applications, so you can focus more on your
project thinking than on the software. It will also behoove you to do regular
reviews and updating of this content, wherever it is, and keep it current with
consistent pur ging and reor ganizing. Remember that the computer is a bit of
a black hole, and as memory and storage capacity continue to expand and
new cool applications for pieces of this functionality continue to proliferate,
it becomes easier to keep everything  and then lose a coordinated orientation
of your active stuf f.
How Do I Apply All This in My W orld?
Just as your Next Actions lists need to be up-to-date, so, too, does your
Projects list. That done, give yourself a block of time, ideally between one
and three hours, to handle as much of the vertical thinking about each project
as you can.
Clear the deck, create a context, and do some creative project thinking.
Y ou’ll then be way ahead of most people.
At the very least, right now or as soon as possible, take those few of your
projects that you have the most attention on or interest in right now and do
some thinking, collecting, and or ganizing on them, using whatever tools
seem most appropriate.
Let our advance worrying become our advance thinking and planning.
—W inston Chur chill
Focus on each, one at a time, top to bottom. As you do, ask yourself, “What
about this do I want to know , capture, or remember?”
Y ou may just want to mind-map some thoughts on a piece of paper , make a
file, and toss the paper into it. Y ou may come up with some simple bullet-
point headings to attach as a note in your digital/mobile or ganizer . Or you
could create a word processing document and start an outline on it.
The key is to get comfortable with having and using your ideas. And to
acquire the habit of focusing your ener gy constructively , on intended
outcomes and open loops, before you have to.
