Getting Projects Creatively Under W ay: The
Five Phases of Project Planning
THE KEY INGREDIENTS of relaxed control are (1) clearly defined
outcomes (projects) and the next actions required to move them toward
closure, and (2) reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed
regularly . This is what I call horizontal focus. Although it may seem simple,
the actual application of the process can create profound results.
Enhancing V ertical Focus
Horizontal focus is all you’ll need in most situations, most of the time.
Sometimes, however , you may need greater rigor and focus to get a project
or situation under control, to identify a solution, or to ensure that all the right
steps have been determined. This is where vertical focus comes in. Knowing
how to think productively in this more vertical way and how to integrate the
results into your personal system is the second powerful behavior set needed
for knowledge work.
Y ou’ve got to think about the big things while you’r e doing small things, so
that all the small  things go in the right dir ection.
—Alvin T offler
This kind of thinking doesn’ t have to be elaborate. Most of the thinking
you’ll need to do is informal, what I call back-of-the-envelope planning—
the
kind of thing you do literally on the back of an envelope or napkin in a
cof fee shop with a colleague as you’re hashing out the agenda and structure
of a sales presentation. In my experience this tends to be the most productive
kind of planning you can do in terms of your output relative to the ener gy
you put into it.
T rue, once in a while everyone may need to develop a more formal structure
or plan to clarify components, sequences, or priorities. And more detailed
outlines will also be necessary to coordinate more complex situations—if
teams need to collaborate about various project pieces, for example, or if
business plans need to be drafted to convince an investor you know what
you’re doing. But as a general rule, you can be pretty creative with nothing
more than a pen and piece of paper .
The goal is to get projects and situations suf ficiently clear and under control
to get them of f your mind, and not to lose any potentially useful ideas.
The greatest need I’ve seen in project thinking in the professional world is
not for more formal models; usually the people who need those models
already have them or can get them as part of an academic or professional
curriculum.
Instead, I’ve found the biggest gap to be the lack of a project-focusing model
for the rest of us. W e need ways to validate and support our thinking, no
matter how informal. Formal planning sessions and high-horsepower
planning tools (such as project management software) can certainly be useful
at times, but too often the participants in a meeting will need to have another
meeting—a back-of-the-envelope (or whiteboard) session—to actually get a
piece of work fleshed out and under control. More formal and structured
meetings also tend to skip over at least one critical issue, such as why the
project is being done in the first place.
Or they don’ t allow adequate time for brainstorming, the development of a
bunch of ideas nobody’ s ever thought about that would make the project
more interesting, more profitable, or just more fun. And finally , very few
such meetings bring to bear suf ficient rigor in determining action steps and
accountabilities for the various aspects of a project plan.
The good news is, there is  a productive way to think about projects,
situations, and topics that creates maximum value with minimal expenditure
of time and ef fort. It happens to be the way we naturally plan when we
consciously try to get a project under control or simply execute for a desired
outcome. In my experience, when people do more planning, informally and
naturally , they
relieve a great deal of stress and  obtain better results.
The Natural Planning Model
The most experienced planner in the world is your brain.
Y ou’re already familiar with the most brilliant and creative planner in the
world: your brain. Y ou yourself are actually a planning machine. Y ou’re
planning when you get dressed, eat lunch, go to the store, or simply talk.
Although the process may seem somewhat random, a quite complex series of
steps has to occur before your brain can make anything happen physically .
Y our mind goes through five steps to accomplish virtually any task:
1 | Defining purpose and principles
2 | Outcome visioning
3 | Brainstorming
4 | Or ganizing
5 | Identifying next actions
A Simple Example: Planning Dinner Out
The last time you went out to dinner , what initially caused you to think about
doing it? It could have been any number of things—the desire to satisfy
hunger , socialize with friends, celebrate a special occasion, sign a business
deal, or develop a romance. As soon as any of these turned into a real
inclination that you wanted to move on, you started planning. Y our intention
was your purpose , and it automatically triggered your internal planning
process. Y our principles  created the boundaries of your plan. Y ou probably
didn’ t consciously think about your principles regarding going out to dinner ,
but you thought within them: standards of food and service, af fordability ,
convenience, and comfort all may have played a part. In any case, your
purpose and principles were the defining impetus and boundaries of your
planning.
Once you decided to fulfill your purpose, what were your first substantive
thoughts? Probably not “Point II.A.3.b. in plan.” Y our first ideas were more
likely things like “Italian food at Giovanni’ s,” or “Sitting at a sidewalk table
at the Bistro Café.” Y ou probably also imagined some positive picture of
what you might experience or how the evening would turn out—maybe the
people involved, the atmosphere, and/or the outcome. That was your
outcome  visioning . Whereas your purpose was the why of your going out to
dinner , your vision was an image of the what —of the physical world’ s
looking, sounding, and feeling the ways that best fulfilled your purpose.
Once you’d identified with your vision, what did your mind naturally begin
doing? What did it start to think about? “What time should we go?” “Is it
open tonight?” “W ill it be crowded?” “What’ s the weather like?” “Should
we change clothes?” “Is there gas in the car?” “How hungry are we?” That
was brainstorming . Those questions were part of the naturally creative
process that happens once you commit to some outcome that hasn’ t
happened yet. Y our brain noticed a gap between what you were looking
toward and where you actually were at the time, and it began to resolve that
cognitive dissonance by trying to fill in the blanks. This is the beginning of
the how  phase of natural planning. But it did the thinking in a somewhat
random and ad hoc fashion. Lots of dif ferent aspects of going to dinner just
occurred to you. Y ou almost certainly didn’ t need to actually write all of
them down on a piece of paper , but you did a version of that process in your
mind. *
The key to intelligent thought is more intelligent thinking.
Once you had generated a suf ficient number of ideas and details, you
couldn’ t help but start to organize  them. Y ou may have thought or said,
“First we need to find out if the restaurant is open,” or “Let’ s call the
Andersons and see if they’d like to go out with us.” Once you’ve generated
various thoughts relevant to the outcome, your mind will automatically
begin to sort them by components (subprojects), priorities, and/or sequences
of events. Components  would be: “W e need to handle logistics, people, and
location.” Priorities  would be: “It’ s critical to find out if the client really
would like to go to dinner .”
Sequences would be: “First we need to check whether the restaurant is open,
then call the Andersons, then get dressed.” This is the section of natural
planning that incorporates challenge , comparisons , and evaluation , by its
very nature. One thing is better , bigger , or ahead of something else.
Finally (assuming that you’re really committed to the project—in this case,
going out to dinner), you focus on the next action  that you need to take to
make the first component actually happen. “Call Café Rouge to see if it’ s
open, and make the reservation.”
These five phases of project planning occur naturally for everything you
accomplish during the day . It’ s how you create things—dinner , a relaxing
evening, a new product, or a new company . Y ou have an ur ge to make
something happen; you image the outcome; you generate ideas that might be
relevant; you sort those into a structure; and you define a physical activity
that would begin to make it a reality . And you do all of that naturally ,
without giving it much thought.
Natural Planning Is Not Necessarily Normal
But is the process described in the previous section the way your committee
is planning the retreat? Is it how your IT team is approaching the new system
installation? Is it how you’re or ganizing the wedding or thinking through the
potential mer ger?
Have you envisioned wild success about anything lately?
Have you clarified the primary purpose of the project and communicated it
to everyone who ought to know it? And have you agreed on the standards
and behaviors you’ll need to adhere to in order to make it successful?
Have you envisioned success and considered all the innovative things that
might result if you achieved it?
Have you gotten all possible ideas out on the table—everything you need to
take into consideration that might af fect the outcome?
Have you identified the mission-critical components, key milestones, and
deliverables?
Have you defined all the aspects of the project that could be moved on right
now , what the next action is for each part, and who’ s responsible for what?
If you’re like most people I interact with in a coaching or consulting
capacity , the collective answer to these questions is, probably not. There are
likely to be at least some components of the natural planning model that you
haven’ t implemented.
In some of my seminars I get participants to actually plan a current strategic
project that uses this model. In only a few minutes they walk themselves
through all five phases, and usually end up being amazed at how much
progress they’ve made compared with what they have tried to do in the past.
One gentleman came up afterward and told me, “I don’ t know whether I
should thank you or be angry .
I just finished a business plan I’ve been telling myself would take months,
and now I have no excuses for not doing it!”
Y ou can try it for yourself right now , if you like. Choose one project that is
new or stuck or that could simply use some improvement. Think of your
purpose. Think of what a successful outcome would look like: where would
you be physically , financially , in terms of reputation, or whatever?
Brainstorm potential steps. Or ganize your ideas. Decide on the next actions.
Are you any clearer about where you want to go and how to get there?
The Unnatural Planning Model
T o emphasize the importance of utilizing the natural planning model for the
more complex things we’re involved with, let’ s contrast it with the more
“normal” model used in most environments—what I call unnatural planning.
When the “Good” Idea Is a Bad Idea
Have you ever heard a well-intentioned manager or project head start a
meeting with the question, “OK, so who’ s got a good idea about this?”
If you’re waiting to have a good idea before you have any ideas, you won’ t
have many .
What’ s the assumption here? Before any evaluation of what’ s a good idea
can be trusted, the purpose must be clear , the vision must be well defined,
and all the relevant data must have been collected (brainstormed) and
analyzed (or ganized). “What’ s a good idea?” is a good question, but only
when you’re about 80 percent of the way through your thinking! Starting
there would
probably blow anyone’ s creative mental fuses.
T rying to approach any situation from a perspective that is not the natural
way your mind operates will be dif ficult. People do it all the time, but it
almost always engenders a lack of clarity and increased stress. In
interactions with others, it opens the door for egos, politics, and hidden
agendas to take over the discussion (generally speaking, the most verbally
aggressive will run the show).
And if it’ s just you, attempting to come up with a good idea before defining
your purpose, creating a vision, and collecting lots of initial bad ideas is
likely to give you a case of creative constipation.
The Reactive Planning Model
When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.
—W ill Rogers
The unnatural model is what most people still consciously think of as
“planning,” and because it’ s so often artificial and irrelevant to real work,
people just don’ t plan. At least not on the front end: they resist planning
meetings, presentations, and strategic operations until the last minute.
But what happens if you don’ t plan ahead of time? In many cases, crisis!
(“Didn’ t you get the tickets?” “I thought you were going to do that!”) Then,
when the ur gency of the last minute is upon you, the reactive planning model
ensues.
What’ s the first level of focus when the stuf f hits the fan? Action! W ork
harder! Overtime! More people! Get busier! And a lot of stressed-out people
are thrown at the situation.
Then, when having a lot of busy people banging into each other doesn’ t
resolve the situation, someone gets more sophisticated and says, “W e need to
get organized !” (Catching on now?) Then people draw boxes around the
problem and label them. Or r edraw  the boxes and r elabel  them.
Don’ t just do something. Stand ther e.
—Rochelle Myer
At some point they realize that just redrawing boxes isn’ t really doing much
to solve the problem. Now someone (much more sophisticated) suggests that
more creativity is needed. “Let’ s brainstorm !” W ith everyone in the room,
the boss asks, “So, who’ s got a good  idea here?”
When not much happens, the boss may surmise that his staf f has used up
most of its internal creativity . T ime to hire a consultant! Of course, if the
consultant is worth his salt, at some point he is probably going to ask the big
question: “So, what are you really trying to do  here, anyway?” ( vision ,
purpose ).
Natural Planning T echniques: The Five Phases
It goes without saying, but still must be said again: thinking in more
ef fective ways about projects and situations can make things happen sooner ,
better , and more successfully . So if our minds plan naturally anyway , what
can we learn from that? How can we use that model to facilitate getting more
and better results in our thinking?
Let’ s examine each of the five phases of natural planning and see how we
can leverage these contexts.
Purpose
It never hurts to ask the why  question. Almost anything you’re currently
doing can be enhanced and even galvanized by more scrutiny at this top
level of focus.
Why are you going to your next meeting? What’ s the purpose of your task?
Why are you having friends over for dinner? Why are you hiring a
marketing director instead of an agency? Why are you putting up with the
situation in your service or ganization? Why do you have a budget? Ad
infinitum.
Fanaticism consists of r edoubling your efforts when you have for gotten your
aim.
—Geor ge Santayana
I admit it: this is nothing but advanced common sense. T o know and to be
clear about the purpose of any activity are prime directives for appropriate
focus, creative development, and cooperation. But it’ s common sense that’ s
not commonly practiced, simply because it’ s so easy for us to create things,
get caught up in the form of what we’ve created, and let our connection with
our real and primary intentions slip.
I know , based upon thousands of hours spent in many of fices with many
sophisticated people, that the why  question cannot be ignored. When people
complain to me about having too many meetings, I have to ask, “What is the
purpose of the meetings?” When they ask, “Who should I invite to the
planning session?” I have to ask, “What’ s the purpose of the planning
session?” When the dilemma is whether to stay connected with work and e-
mail on a vacation or not, I have to ask, “What’ s the primary purpose of the
vacation?” Until we have the answer to my questions, there’ s no possible
way to come up with an appropriate response to theirs.
The V alue of Thinking About Why
Here are just some of the benefits of asking why:
It defines success.
It creates decision-making criteria.
It aligns resources.
It motivates.
It clarifies focus.
It expands options.
People love to win. If you’re not totally clear about the purpose of what
you’re doing, you have no game to win.
Let’ s take a closer look at each of these in turn.
It Defines Success People are starved for “wins” these days. W e love to play
games, and we like to win, or at least be in a position where we could win.
And if you’re not totally clear about the purpose of what you’re doing, you
have no chance of winning. Purpose defines success. It’ s the primal
reference point for any investment of time and ener gy , from deciding to run
for elective of fice to
designing a form.
Ultimately you can’ t feel good about a staf f meeting unless you know what
the purpose of the meeting was. And if you want to sleep well, you’d better
have a good answer when your board asks why you fired your head of
marketing or hired that hotshot MBA as your new finance director . Y ou
won’ t really know whether or not your business plan is any good until you
hold it up against the success criterion that you define by answering the
question, “Why do we need a business plan?”
It Cr eates Decision-Making Criteria How do you decide whether to spend
the money for a five-color brochure or just go with a two-color? How do you
know whether it’ s worth hiring a major W eb design firm to handle your new
W eb site?
How do you know if you should send your daughter to private school?
Often the only way to make a hard decision is to come back to the purpose
of what you’re doing.
It all comes down to purpose. Given what you’re trying to accomplish, are
these investments required? There’ s no way to know until the purpose is
defined.
It Aligns Resour ces How should we spend our staf fing allocation in the
corporate budget? How do we best use the cash flow right now to maximize
our viability as a retailer over the next year? Should we spend more money
on the luncheon or on the speakers for the monthly association meeting?
In each case, the answer depends on what we’re really trying to accomplish
—the why .
If you’re not sure why you’re doing something, you can never do enough of
it.
It Motivates Let’ s face it: if there’ s no good reason to be doing something,
it’ s not worth doing. I’m often stunned by how many people have for gotten
why they’re doing what they’re doing—and by how quickly a simple
question like,
“Why are you doing that?” can get them back on track.
It Clarifies Focus When you land on the real purpose for anything you’re
doing,
it makes things clearer . Just taking two minutes and writing out your primary
reason for doing something invariably creates an increased sharpness of
vision, much like bringing a telescope into focus. Frequently , projects and
situations that have begun to feel scattered and blurred grow clearer when
someone brings it back home by asking, “What are we really trying to
accomplish here?”
It Expands Options Paradoxically , even as purpose brings things into
pinpoint focus, it opens up creative thinking about wider possibilities. When
you really know the underlying why —for the conference, for the staf f party ,
for your vacation, for the elimination of the management position, or for the
mer ger—it expands your thinking about how to make the desired result
happen. When people write out their purpose for a project in my seminars,
they often claim it’ s like a fresh breeze blowing through their mind,
clarifying their vision of what they’re doing.
Is your purpose clear and specific enough? If you’re truly experiencing the
benefits of a purpose focus—motivation, clarity , decision-making criteria,
alignment, and creativity—then your purpose probably is  specific enough.
But many purpose statements are too vague to produce such results. “T o
have a good team,” for example, might be too broad or vague a goal. After
all, what constitutes a “good team”? Is it a group of people who are highly
motivated, collaborating in healthy ways, and taking initiative? Or is it a
team that comes in under budget? In other words, if you don’ t really know
when you’ve met your purpose or when you’re of f track, you don’ t have a
viable directive. The question, “How will I know when this is of f purpose?”
must have a clear answer .
Principles
Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent
behavior . Complex  rules and r egulations give rise to simple and stupid
behavior .
—Dee Hock
Of equal value as prime criteria for driving and directing a project are the
standards and values you hold. Although people seldom think about these
consciously , they are always there. And if they are violated, the result will
inevitably be unproductive distraction and stress.
A great way to think about what your principles are is to complete this
sentence: “I would give others totally free rein to do this as long as they . . .”
As long as they what? What policies, stated or unstated, will apply to your
group’ s activities? “As long as they stayed within budget”? “satisfied the
client”?
“ensured a healthy team”? “promoted a positive image”?
It can be a major source of stress when others engage in or allow behavior
that’ s outside your standards. If you never have to deal with this issue,
you’re truly graced. If you do, some constructive conversation about, and
clarification of, principles could align the ener gy and prevent unnecessary
conflict. Y ou may want to begin by asking yourself, “What behavior might
undermine what I’m doing, and how can I prevent it?” That will give you a
good starting point for defining your standards.
Another great reason for focusing on principles is the clarity and reference
point they provide for positive conduct. How do you want or need to work
with others on this project to ensure its success? What behaviors are in- and
out-of-bounds for your kids on the family vacation? Y ou and others are at
your best when you’re acting how?
Whereas purpose provides the juice and the direction, principles define the
parameters of action and the criteria for excellence of conduct.
V ision/Outcome
In order to most productively access the conscious and unconscious
resources available to you, you must have a clear picture in your mind of
what success would look, sound, and feel like. Purpose and principles
furnish the impetus and the monitoring, but vision provides the actual
blueprint of the final result. This is the what  instead of the why . What will
this project or situation really be like when it successfully appears in the
world?
For example, graduates of your seminar are demonstrating consistently
applied knowledge of the subject matter . Market share has increased 2
percent within the northeastern region over the last fiscal year . Y our
daughter is clear about your guidelines and support for her first semester in
college.
The Power of Focus
Imagination is mor e important than knowledge.
—Albert Einstein
Since the 1960s thousands of books have expounded on the value of
appropriate positive imagery and focus. Forward-looking focus has even
been a key element in Olympic-level sports training, with athletes imagining
the physical ef fort, the positive ener gy , and the successful result to ensure
the highest level of unconscious support for their performance.
W e know that the focus we hold in our minds af fects what we perceive and
how we perform. This is as true on the golf course as it is in a staf f meeting
or during a serious conversation with a life partner . My interest here lies in
providing a model for focus that is dynamic in a practical way , especially in
project thinking.
When you focus on something—the vacation you’re going to take, the
meeting you’re about to go into, the project you want to launch—that focus
instantly creates ideas and thought patterns you wouldn’ t have had
otherwise.
Even your physiology will respond to an image in your head as if it were
reality .
The Reticular Activating System The May 1957 issue of Scientific American
magazine contains an article describing the discovery of the reticular
formation at the base of the brain. The reticular formation is basically the
gateway to your conscious awareness; it’ s the switch that turns on your
perception of ideas and data, the thing that keeps you asleep even when
music’ s playing but wakes you if a special little baby cries in another room.
Y our automatic cr eative mechanism is teleological. That is, it operates in
terms of goals and end  r esults. Once you give it a definite goal to achieve,
you can depend upon its automatic guidance  system to take you to that goal
much better than “you” ever could by conscious thought. “Y ou”
supply the goal by thinking in terms of end r esults. Y our automatic
mechanism then supplies the  means wher eby .
—Maxwell Maltz
Just like a computer , your brain has a search function—but it’ s even more
phenomenal than a computer ’ s. It seems to be programmed by what we
focus on and, more primarily , what we identify with. It’ s the seat of what
many people
have referred to as the paradigms we maintain. W e notice only what matches
our internal belief systems and identified contexts. If you’re an optometrist,
for example, you’ll tend to notice people wearing eyeglasses across a
crowded room; if you’re a building contractor , you may notice the room’ s
physical details. If you focus on the color red right now and then just glance
around your environment, if there is any red at all, you’ll see even the tiniest
bits of it.
The implications of how this filtering works—how we are unconsciously
made conscious of information—could fill a weeklong seminar , if not the
rest of your life! Suf fice it to say that something automatic and extraordinary
happens in your mind when you create and focus on a clear picture of what
you want.
Clarifying Outcomes
There is a simple but profound principle that emer ges from understanding
the way your perceptive filters work: you won’ t see how to do it until you
see yourself doing it.
Y ou often need to make it up in your mind before you can make it happen in
your life.
It’ s easy to envision something happening if it has happened before or you
have had experience with similar successes. It can be quite a challenge,
however , to identify with images of success if they represent new and
foreign territory—
that is, if you have few reference points about what an event might actually
look like and little experience of your own ability to make it happen.
Many of us hold ourselves back from imagining a desired outcome unless
someone can show us how to get ther e . Unfortunately , that’ s backward in
terms of how our minds work to generate and recognize solutions and
methods.
I always wanted to be somebody . I should have been mor e specific.
—Lily T omlin
One of the most powerful life skills, and one of the most important to hone
and develop for both professional and personal success, is creating clear
outcomes. This is not as self-evident as it may sound. W e need to constantly
define (and redefine) what we’re trying to accomplish on many dif ferent
levels, and consistently reallocate resources toward getting these tasks
complete as ef fectively and ef ficiently as possible.
What will this project look like when it’ s done? How do you want the client
to feel, and what do you want him to know and do after the presentation?
Where will you be in your career three years from now? How would the
ideal head of finance do his job? What would your W eb site really look like
and have as capabilities if it could be the way you wanted it? What would
your relationship with your son feel like if this conversation you need to
have with him were successful?
Outcome/vision can range from a simple statement of the project, such as
“Finalize computer -system implementation,” to a completely scripted movie
depicting the future scene in all its glorious detail.
When I am able to get people to focus on a successful scenario of their
project, they usually experience heightened enthusiasm and think of
something unique and positive about it that didn’ t occur to them before.
“W ouldn’ t it be great if . . .” is not a bad way to start thinking about a
situation, at least for long enough to have the option of getting an answer .
Brainstorming
The best way to get a good idea is to get lots of ideas.
—Linus Pauling
Once you know what you want to happen and why , the how  mechanism is
brought into play . When you identify with some picture in your mind that is
dif ferent from your current reality , you automatically start filling in the gaps,
or brainstorming. Ideas begin to pop into your head in somewhat random
order—
little ones, big ones, not-so-good ones, good ones. This process usually goes
on internally for most people about most things, and that’ s often suf ficient.
For example, you think about what you want to say to your boss as you’re
walking down the hall to speak to her . But there are many other instances
when writing things down, or capturing them in some external way , can give
a tremendous boost to productive output and thinking.
Y our mind wants to figure out how to get from here to there, but initially in
somewhat random order .
Capturing Y our Ideas
Over the past several decades, a number of graphics-oriented brainstorming
techniques have been introduced to help develop creative thinking about
projects and topics. They’ve been given names such as mind mapping,
clustering, patterning, webbing, and fish boning. Although the authors of
these various processes may portray them as being dif ferent from one
another , for most of us end users the basic premise remains the same: give
yourself permission to capture and express any idea, and then later on figure
out how it fits in and what to do with it. If nothing else (and there is plenty
of “else”), this practice adds to your ef ficiency—when you have the idea,
you grab it, which means you won’ t have to have the idea again.
The most popular of these concepts and techniques is called mind mapping,
a name coined by T ony Buzan, a British researcher in brain functioning, to
label this process of brainstorming ideas into a graphic format. In mind
mapping, the core idea is presented in the center , with associated ideas
growing out in a somewhat free-form fashion around it. For instance, if I
found out that I had to move my of fice, I might think about computers,
changing my business cards, all the connections I’d have to change, new
furniture, moving the phones, pur ging and packing, and so on. If I capture
these thoughts graphically it might start to look something like this:
Y ou could do this kind of mind mapping on Post-its that could be stuck on a
whiteboard, or you could input ideas into a word processing program,
outlining program, or one of the many mind-mapping software applications
on the market.
Distributed Cognition
The great thing about external brainstorming is that in addition to capturing
your original ideas, it can help generate many new ones that might not have
occurred to you if you didn’ t have a mechanism to hold your thoughts and
continually reflect them back to you. It’ s as if your mind were to say , “Look,
I’m only going to give you as many ideas as you feel you can ef fectively
use. If you’re not collecting them in some trusted way , I won’ t give you that
many . But if you’re actually doing something with the ideas—even if it’ s
just recording them for later evaluation—then here, have a bunch! And, oh
wow! That reminds me of another one, and another ,” etc.
Nothing is mor e danger ous than an idea when it is the only one you have.
—Emile Chartier
Psychologists have now labeled this and similar processes “distributed
cognition.” It’ s getting things out of your head and into objective, reviewable
formats—building an “extended mind.” But my English teacher in high
school didn’ t have to know about the theory to give me the key: “David,” he
said,
“you’re going to college, and you’re going to be writing papers. W rite all
your notes and quotes on separate three-by-five-inch cards. Then, when you
get ready to or ganize your thinking, just spread them all out on the floor , see
the natural structure that emer ges, and figure out what’ s missing. Mr .
Edmundson was teaching me a major piece of the natural planning model!
Only he who handles his ideas lightly is master of his ideas, and only he who
is master of his  ideas is not enslaved by them.
—Lin Y utang
Few people can hold their focus on a topic for more than a couple of minutes
without some objective structure and tool or trigger to help them. Pick a big
project you have going right now and just try to think of nothing else for
more than thirty seconds. This is pretty hard to do unless you have a pen and
paper in hand and use one of those “cognitive artifacts” as the anchor for
your ideas.
Then you can stay with it for hours. That’ s why good thinking can happen
while you’re working on a computer document about a project, mind
mapping it on a notepad, doodling about it on a paper tablecloth, or just
having a meeting about it with other people in a room that allows you to
hold the context (a whiteboard with nice wet markers really helps there, too).
Brainstorming Keys
Many techniques can be used to facilitate brainstorming and out-of-the-box
thinking. The basic principles, however , can be summed up as follows:
Don’ t judge, challenge, evaluate, or criticize.
Go for quantity , not quality .
Put analysis and or ganization in the background.
Determining what might go most wrong in a situation is at times the best
way to generate the best ideas about how to make it successful.
Don’ t Judge, Challenge, Evaluate, or Criticize It’ s easy for the unnatural
planning model to rear its ugly head in brainstorming, making people jump
to premature evaluations and critiques of ideas. If you care even slightly
about what a critic thinks, you’ll censor your expressive process as you look
for the
“right” thing to say . There’ s a very subtle distinction between keeping
brainstorming on tar get with the topic and stifling the creative process. It’ s
also important that brainstorming be put into the overall context of the
planning process, because if you think you’re doing it just for its own sake, it
can seem trite and inappropriately of f course. If you can understand it
instead as something you’re doing right now , for a certain period, before you
move toward a resolution at the end, you’ll feel more comfortable giving this
part of the process its due.
This is not to suggest that you should shut of f critical thinking, though—
everything ought to be fair game at this stage. “Here’ s what might be wrong
with that approach” needs to be on the table, if it’ s present. Often it’ s the
most challenging and critical ideas that have the germ of the best ones. It’ s
just wise to understand what kinds of thoughts you’re having and to park
them for use in the most appropriate way . The primary criteria must be
inclusion and expansion, not constriction and contraction.
Go for Quantity , Not Quality Going for quantity keeps your thinking
expansive.
Often you won’ t know what’ s a good idea until you have it. And sometimes
you’ll realize it’ s a good idea, or the germ of one, only later on. Y ou know
how shopping at a big store with lots of options lets you feel comfortable
about your choice? The same holds true for project thinking. The greater the
volume of thoughts you have to work with, the better the context you can
create for developing options and trusting your choices.
Put Analysis and Or ganization in the Backgr ound Analysis and evaluation
and or ganization of your thoughts should be given as free a rein as creative,
out-of-
the-box thinking. But in the brainstorming phase, this critical activity should
not be the driver .
Making a list can be a creative thing to do; it’ s a way to consider the people
who should be on your team, the customer requirements for the software, or
the components of the business plan. Just make sure to grab all that and keep
going until you get into the weeding and or ganizing of focus that make up
the next stage.
Organizing
A project plan identifies the smaller outcomes, which can then be naturally
planned.
If you’ve done a thorough job of emptying your head of all the things that
came up in the brainstorming phase, you’ll notice that a natural or ganization
is emer ging. As my high school English teacher suggested, once you get all
the ideas out of your head and in front of your eyes, you’ll automatically
notice natural relationships and structure. This is what most people are
referring to when they talk about or ganizing a project.
Or ganizing usually happens when you identify components and
subcomponents, sequences of events, and/or priorities. What are the things
that must occur to create the final result? In what order must they occur?
What is the most important element to ensure the success of the project?
This is the stage in which you can make good use of structuring tools
ranging from informal bullet points scribbled on the back of an envelope to
heavy-horsepower project-planning software. When a project calls for
substantial objective control, you’ll need some type of hierarchical outline
with components and subcomponents, and/or a Gantt-type chart showing
stages of the project laid out over time, with independent and dependent
parts and milestones identified in relationship to the whole.
Creative thinking doesn’ t stop here; it just takes another form. Once you
perceive a basic structure, your mind will start trying to fill in the blanks.
Identifying the three key things that you need to handle on the project, for
example, may cause you to think of a fourth and a fifth when you see them
all lined up.
The Basics of Organizing
The key steps here are:
Identify the significant pieces
Sort by (one or more):
components
sequences
priorities
Detail to the required degree
I have never seen any two projects that needed to have exactly the same
amount of structure and detail developed in order to get things of f people’ s
minds and moving successfully . But almost all projects can use some form
of creative thinking from the sequential part of the brain, along the lines of
“What’ s the plan?”
Next Actions
The final stage of planning comes down to decisions about the allocation and
reallocation of physical resources to actually get the project moving. The
question to ask here is, “What’ s the next action?”
As we noted in the previous chapter , this kind of grounded, reality-based
thinking, combined with clarification of the desired outcome, forms the
critical component for defining and clarifying what our real work is. In my
experience, creating a list of what your real projects are and consistently
managing your next action for each one will constitute 90 percent of what is
generally thought of as project planning. This ground-floor approach will
make you honest about all kinds of things. Are you really serious about
doing this? Who’ s responsible?
Have you thought things through enough?
At some point, if the project is an actionable one, this next-action-thinking
decision must be made. *  Answering the question about what, specifically ,
you would do about something physically if you had nothing else to do will
test the maturity of your thinking about the project. If you’re not yet ready to
answer that question, you have more to flesh out at some prior level in the
natural planning sequence.
The Basics
Decide on next actions for each of the current “moving parts” of the project.
Decide on the next action in the planning process, if necessary .
Activating the Moving Parts A project is suf ficiently planned for
implementation when every next-action step has been decided on every front
that can actually be moved on without some other component’ s having to be
completed first. If the project has multiple components, each of them should
be assessed appropriately by asking, “Is there something that anyone could
be doing on this right now?”
Y ou could be coordinating speakers for the conference, for instance, at the
same time that you’re finding the appropriate site.
In some cases there will be only one aspect that can be activated, and
everything else will depend on the results of that. So there may be only one
next action, which will be the linchpin for all the rest.
Mor e to Plan? What if there’ s still more planning to be done before you can
feel comfortable with what’ s next? There’ s still an action step—it is just a
process action. What’ s the next step in the continuation of planning?
Drafting more ideas. E-mailing Ana Maria and Sean to get their input.
T elling your assistant to set up a planning meeting with the product team.
The habit of clarifying the next action on projects, no matter what the
situation, is fundamental to you staying in relaxed control.
When the Next Action Is Someone Else’ s . . . If the next action is not yours,
you must nevertheless clarify whose it is (this is a primary use of the W aiting
For action list). In a group-planning situation, it isn’ t necessary for everyone
to know what the next step is on every part of the project. Often all that’ s
required is to allocate responsibility for parts of the project to the appropriate
persons and leave it up to them to identify next actions on their particular
pieces.
This next-action conversation forces or ganizational clarity . Issues and details
emer ge that don’ t show up until someone holds everyone’ s feet to the fire
about the physical-level reality of resource allocation. It’ s a simple practical
discussion to foster , and one that can significantly stir the pot and identify
weak links.
How Much Planning Do Y ou Really Need to Do?
How much of this planning model do you really need to flesh out, and to
what degree of detail? The simple answer is, as much as you need to get the
project of f your mind.
In general, the reason things are on your mind is that the outcome and action
step(s) have not been appropriately defined, and/or reminders of them have
not been put in places where you can be trusted to look for them
appropriately .
Additionally , you may not have developed the details, perspectives, and
solutions suf ficiently to trust the ef ficacy of your blueprint.
If the project is still on your mind, there’ s more thinking required.
Most projects, given my definition of a project as an outcome requiring more
than one action, need no more than a listing of their outcome and next action
for you to get them of f your mind. Y ou need a new stockbroker? Y ou just
have to call a friend for a recommendation. Y ou want to set up a new printer
at home?
Y ou just need to surf the W eb to check out dif ferent models and prices. I
estimate that 80 percent of projects are of that nature. Y ou’ll still be doing
the full planning model on all of them, but only in your head, and just
enough to figure out next actions and keep them going until they’re
complete.
Another 15 percent or so of projects might require at least some external
form of brainstorming—maybe a mind map or a few notes in a word
processing or presentation program. That might be suf ficient for planning
meeting agendas, your vacation, or a speech to the local chamber of
commerce.
A final 5 percent of projects might need the deliberate application of one or
more of the five phases of the natural planning model. The model provides
a practical recipe for unsticking things, resolving them, and moving them
forward productively . Are you aware of a need for greater clarity , or great
action, on any of your projects? If so, using the model can often be the key
to making ef fective progress.
Need Mor e Clarity?
If greater clarity is what you need, shift your thinking up the natural
planning scale. People are often very busy (action) but nonetheless
experience confusion and a lack of clear direction. They need to pull out the
plan or create one (or ganize). If there’ s a lack of clarity at the planning
level, there’ s probably a
need for more brainstorming to generate a suf ficient inventory of current
ideas and data to create trust in the plan. If the brainstorming session gets
bogged down with fuzzy thinking, the focus should shift back to the vision
of the outcome, ensuring that the reticular filter in the brain will open up to
deliver the how-to thinking. If the outcome/vision is unclear , you must
return to a clean analysis of why you’re engaged in the situation in the first
place (purpose).
Need Mor e to Be Happening?
If more action is what’ s needed, you need to move down the model. There
may be enthusiasm about the purpose of a project but at the same time some
resistance to actually fleshing out what fulfilling it in the real world might
look like. These days, the task of improving quality of work life may be on
the radar for a manager , but often he won’ t yet have defined a clear picture
of the desired result. The thinking must go to the specifics of the vision.
Again, ask yourself,
“What would the outcome look like?”
If you’ve formulated an answer to that question, but things are still stuck,
it’ s probably time for you to grapple with some of the how  issues and the
operational details and perspectives (brainstorming). I often have clients
who have inherited a relatively clearly articulated project, such as
“Implement the new performance-review system,” but who aren’ t moving
forward because they haven’ t yet taken a few minutes to dump some ideas
out about what that might entail.
If brainstorming gets hung up (and very often it does for the more “blue
sky”
types), rigor may be required to do some evaluation of and decision making
about mission-critical deliverables that have to be handled (or ganizing).
This is sometimes the case when an informal back-and-forth meeting that
has generated lots of ideas ends without producing any decision about what
actually needs to happen next on the project.
And if there is  a plan, but the rubber still isn’ t hitting the road like it should,
someone needs to assess each component with the focus of “What’ s the
next action, and who’ s got it?” One manager , who had taken over
responsibility many months in advance for or ganizing a major annual
conference, asked me how to prevent the crisis all-nighters her team had
experienced near the deadline of the previous year . When she produced an
outline of the various pieces of the project she’d inherited, I asked, “Which
pieces could actually be moved on right now?”
After identifying half a dozen, we clarified the next action on each one. It
was of f and running, in time to prevent a repeat of the previous year ’ s last-
minute
chaos.

In the prior two chapters, I covered the basic models of how to stay
maximally productive and in control, with minimal ef fort, at the two most
basic levels of our life and work: the actions we take and the projects we
enter into that generate many of those actions.
Y ou need no new skills to increase your productivity and reduce your stress
—just an enhanced set of systematic behaviors with which to apply them.
The fundamentals remain true—you must be responsible for collecting all
your open loops, applying a front-end thought process to each of them, and
managing the results with or ganization, review , and action.
Plans get you into things but you’ve got to work your way out.
—W ill Rogers
For all those situations that you have any level of commitment to complete,
there is a natural planning process that occurs to get you from here to there.
Leveraging that five-phase model can often make the evolution easier ,
faster , and more productive.
These models are simple to understand and easy to implement. Applying
them creates remarkable results. Y ou need essentially no new skills—you
already know how to write things down, clarify outcomes, decide next
actions, put things into categories, review it all, and make intuitive choices.
Right now  you have the ability to focus on successful results, brainstorm,
or ganize your thinking, and get moving on your next steps.
But just knowing how to do all of those things does not produce results.
Merely having the ability to be highly productive, relaxed, and in control
doesn’ t make you that way . If you’re like most people, you could use a
coach—someone to walk you step-by-step through the experience and
provide some guideposts and handy tricks along the way , until your new
operational style is elegantly
embedded.
Y ou’ll find that in part 2.
