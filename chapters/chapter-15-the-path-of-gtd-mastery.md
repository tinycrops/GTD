*Part 3: The Power of the Key Principles*

The Path of GTD Mastery
GTD IS ACTUALL Y a lifelong practice with multiple levels of mastery . It
is very similar to playing an instrument like the violin, a sport like tennis, or
a game like chess. It’ s like mathematics, pottery , art history , or even
parenting. All of these endeavors involve learning and applying a particular
set of moves and techniques, and there’ s no end to how good you can
become at them, or how many subtleties there are to explore.
GTD is the art of dealing with the stream of life’ s work and engagements,
which itself is constantly evolving for all of us, at any age or station. It’ s
about identifying and navigating your commitments and interests from a
state of confidence and flow . Y our work and focus will change, often
dramatically , over time. But engaging with all of it masterfully is a defined
practice that can be learned and refined over a lifetime.
Mastery  does not refer to some final end state of a Zen-like peacefulness and
enlightenment on a mountaintop (though that could be an optional nice
expression of it). Rather , it’ s the demonstrated ability to consistently engage
in productive behaviors as a means to achieve clarity , stability , and focus
when it’ s desired or required—no matter what the challenge.
How well you have developed that ability will be tested when you’re
confronted with things that are unclear , unstable, and distracting, which are
natural and normal symptoms of any change in your world. The idea of
“mind like water” doesn’ t assume that water is always undisturbed. On the
contrary , water engages appropriately with disturbance, instead of fighting
against it. Over the course of life such disturbances can range from dealing
with your homework in the sixth grade to the demands of your new job to
the vague sense of uneasiness about what to do when you retire.
GTD mastery involves learning and incorporating its various best practices,
and then integrating them in a holistic manner , which results in a much more
dynamic experience than simply the sum of its parts. When you learn to play
tennis, you focus on specific components of its moves, like the backhand,
the forehand, the lob, and the serve. When you actually play a game of
tennis, you then put them all together . As you increase your mastery , your
focus matures to encompass an overall strategy . Similarly , mastering GTD
involves an initial mastery of its segments, techniques, and tools and then
incorporating them as you play your whole life and work game. Y our
expertise will be reflected in your using an optimally integrated system and
approach, without thinking about it.
The Three T iers of Mastery
Over the many years of engaging with people who have adopted the GTD
methodology , I have noticed generally three stages of maturity they have
demonstrated in using the model:
1 | Employing the fundamentals of managing workflow;
2 | Implementing a more elevated and integrated total life management
system; and
3 | Leveraging skills to create clear space and get things done for an ever -
expansive expression and manifestation.
A good analogy here is the experience of learning to drive a car . The first
stage is getting the basics under control, so that you can handle the machine
without hurting yourself or anyone else. The moves feel awkward and often
counterintuitive. But once you’re good enough to get your license, your
world changes dramatically for the better , because now you can go places
and do things that you couldn’ t previously . Then there comes a time when
you are able to drive down a road without actually thinking about the act of
driving—it’ s become an almost automatic part of your life. And finally , you
decide to graduate to a really high-performance vehicle, in which the prime
challenge and opportunity is how well you can focus ahead, making yourself
essentially one with your vehicle, experiencing elevated levels of satisfaction
and fulfillment with driving.
Each of those stages is represented by the horizons of your focus and the
application of specific techniques. At first you’re making what look like
small,
jerky movements but what are actually very smooth movements focused on
very short horizons. Then, as you gain comfort and familiarity with the
process, you extend your focus to the next street corner or freeway exit.
Then you can graduate to a more conscious and directed focus at multiple
horizons, driving across town with total situational awareness. Similarly , as
the techniques of Getting Things Done  become increasingly second nature,
you shift your attention from the mechanics of your system to the results it
produces.
Mastering the Basics
As simple as they may seem at first, building proficiency with the
fundamental components of Getting Things Done —the basics—can take a
while. Though it’ s easy to understand and agree with its concepts and
principles, putting them fully into practice is not necessarily a smooth or
automatic process. It’ s the same as with any sophisticated practice—driving
a car , throwing a karate punch, or playing the flute—the beginning moves
are not familiar or comfortable. Once you’ve done them a thousand times,
however , you can manifest elegance, power , and fluidity that would be
inaccessible any other way . The same may be true for you about learning
GTD.
For example, capturing everything  potentially meaningful into trusted
external buckets, so that nothing remains rattling around in your head, is a
behavior that can be as daunting to employ as learning to manually shift
easily in a car . As with most aspects of the GTD model, writing things down
is itself not a new skill, but rather a practice that can easily seem unworthy
of the ef fort, if not downright counterintuitive. (“If it’ s not immediately
important, why should I bother?”) Becoming sensitized to the need to
externalize those kinds of thoughts as well as building the habit to actually
carry out the necessary actions with a ubiquitous tool at hand, without
exception, is the real challenge.
Other basic practices, which, even if implemented initially , easily regress
into incomplete, out-of-date, and therefore dysfunctional usage, include:
A voiding next-action decision making on “stuf f to do”
Fully utilizing the “W aiting For” category , such that every  expected
deliverable from others is inventoried and reviewed for follow-up in
adequate timing
Using Agenda lists to capture and manage communications with others
Keeping a simple, easily accessible filing and reference system Keeping the
calendar as pure “hard landscape” without undermining its trustworthiness
with extraneous inputs
Doing W eekly Reviews to keep one’ s system functional and current It’ s
Easy to Get Off T rack . . .
If you are sincere about implementing Getting Things Done , it’ s actually not
that dif ficult to get started, as I’ve tried to assure you with the instructions
given in the earlier sections of the book. At some point, though, the rest of
your reality will inevitably come flooding at you full force, and if the new
practices haven’ t yet had time to root themselves in your behavior patterns,
it’ s relatively easy to get blown of f course.
Most people are so used to keeping things in their heads that it’ s very easy to
slip back into that familiar pattern. Deciding next actions requires a thrust of
cognitive ef fort that seductively can be avoided if a particular situation is not
in some critical mode. Making time for the W eekly Review , if it’ s not been
instituted as a habit, can be a daunting challenge. All of that begins to result
in a personal system that is incomplete and out of date—you’ll no longer be
able to trust your lists to give you the whole picture, and because the system
is not really relieving pressure, you’ll conclude it’ s not worth keeping up
with anymore, and you might as well take it back into your head. In those
circumstances it’ s not uncommon for someone to wander of f the track
exponentially quickly .
. . . and Easy to Get Back On
The good news is that it’ s as easy to get back into  your productive groove as
it may have been to get knocked out of it. It simply requires revisiting the
basics: get a pen and paper and empty your head again; clean up your lists of
actions and projects; identify and add new projects and next actions to bring
your lists current; clean up what’ s leaked outside your system.
This cycle of getting of f track and getting back on again happens to almost
everyone—particularly during this first level of mastering the basics of the
game. In my experience it can easily take as long as two years to finally get
this stage of practice fully integrated into one’ s life and work style, and
consistently
maintained.
Another piece of good news is that even if a person has gleaned only a few
concepts from this material, or has not implemented the system regularly , it
can bring marked improvement. If you “get” nothing more than the two-
minute rule, it will be worth its weight in gold. If you just write down a few
more things on your mind than you would have previously , you’ll sleep
better . If you clean up e-mail to zero at least every once in a while, you will
have great cause for celebration. And if you simply ask, “What’ s the next
action?” of yourself or anyone else when you might not have otherwise, it
will add to your stress-free productivity .
Of course, the more those techniques begin to work together as a whole,
systematically and consistently , the more dramatic will be the increase in the
experience of relaxed, focused control. Mastering the basics is
transformative for most everyone who achieves it. If you reach that stage,
you will be getting many more things done, more quickly and more easily ,
and operating with greatly increased confidence in how you’re dealing with
the operational details of life.
At this first tier of GTD mastery you will be generally keeping yourself
under control and focused on an hour -by-hour , day-by-day basis.
Graduate Level—Integrated Life Management
At this point, you are ready to graduate to the next level—having your hand
on the helm of your life on a week-to-week, month-to-month (and even
longer) basis. This requires a more subtle level of awareness and practice. As
I mentioned earlier , as you get better at driving a car , you are able to extend
your horizon, which creates smoother moves, and you can focus more on
where you’re going than on the mechanism that’ s getting you there.
Similarly , when you reach a certain level of maturity with the GTD process,
you won’ t be as focused on the system itself or how you’re working it, but
will utilize it in more flexible, customized ways, as your trusted tool to
facilitate control and focus over longer and lar ger spans.
Whereas the first level of mastery involves in-trays, meetings, e-mail, phone
calls, agendas, waiting-fors, reference systems, list management, getting the
right tools, etc., this next tier is concerned with getting rigorous with the
bigger issues that are driving the contents of the basic level. These specific
actions and information exist because of their relevance to things lar ger than
themselves—
the projects we have to complete, the problems we need to solve, the areas of
focus and interest we have in our complex lives. Why are you getting that e-
mail? What’ s the purpose of that meeting, and why do you have to attend?
What’ s coming up next quarter that you need to start dealing with now?
What
“projects” need to become “someday/maybes,” and vice versa, because of
some of the lar ger changes going on?
Mastery of the fundamentals, which provides the basics of ef fective and
ef ficient execution, also provides the ability and room to address a higher
level of control and focus—projects, and how they are identified, managed,
and understood in relation to one another and to the lar ger frameworks
within which we operate. Developing comfort with an external mind frees up
and leverages one’ s cognitive abilities, paving the way for many more
creative and productive uses of an integrated self-management system.
The hallmarks of this next level of maturity with Getting Things Done are: a
complete, current, and clear inventory of projects;
a working map of one’ s roles, accountabilities, and interests—personally and
professionally;
an integrated total life management system, custom tailored to one’ s current
needs and direction and utilized to dynamically steer out beyond the day-
today; and
challenges and surprises trigger your utilization of this methodology instead
of throwing you out of it.
When Pr ojects Become the Heartbeat of Y our Operational System
Further down the path of mastering this methodology you will reach a stage
at which your Projects list becomes more the driver , rather than a reflection,
of your Next Action lists, and your projects themselves will become a truer
reflection of your roles, areas of focus, and interests. At this point the center
of gravity of your self-management system will have moved from the
Ground-level horizon to somewhere between Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 (refer
to  page 55  in chapter 2).
Though it is central to an ongoing experience of stress-free productivity ,
very few people—even among those who have been engaged with Getting
Things  Done  for years—actually walk around with a complete inventory of
their projects, objectively and regularly reviewed. Those who do reach this
level,
however , and come to realize its power , make that the principle list from
which they navigate.
Given my broad definition of pr oject  (any outcome requiring more than one
step that you’re committed to achieve within a year), it might be challenging
enough for you to delineate all of those, even if they are clear (“Get new
tires,”
“Fix the printer ,” “Find a new babysitter ,” etc.). But the real expression of
maturity here is the inclusion of the more subtle desired outcomes definable
as doable events (“Clarify Frank’ s new role on the team,” “Research options
for improving Bettina’ s math grades,” “Resolve property boundary issue
with neighbor ,” etc.). A signpost of GTD mastery at this stage—and, indeed,
life  mastery!—is when one recognizes anything  that has his or her attention
(concerns, worries, problems, issues, tensions) and translates them into
achievable outcomes (projects), to be executed with concrete next actions.
Most people resist acknowledging issues and opportunities until they know
they can be handled successfully , not realizing that exploring, looking into,
or in some way accepting or putting something to bed because there is no
solution is an appropriate outcome (project) itself. The ability to create
appropriate engagement with your neighbor ’ s boundary issue, your
daughter ’ s math grades, or the role of a new team member—no matter how
ambiguous or unclear the actual path for achieving each may be—by
identifying the inherent project and taking steps to resolve it is quite an
extraordinary and mature self-management practice.
Assessing and Populating Y our Pr ojects List fr om Y our Ar eas of Focus
Everything we do is serving some aspect of the roles and accountabilities we
have taken on or an area of interest and engagement in our lives. I call my
brother just to check in and say hello because “family relationships” has
meaning for me. I buy groceries because I consider “health and vitality”
important. I produce an agenda for a board meeting because I need to
maintain
“corporate oversight” in my role in my company .
Whenever people actually produce a checklist for this horizon—the areas of
professional and personal focus they can identify—they invariably realize
that there are more projects they need to add. They will also usually realize
that they have not been paying appropriate attention to some aspect of either
their work or their personal life, or both, and they are motivated to bring
more balance and
wholeness to their Projects list.
An Integrated T otal Life-Management System
The third aspect of this stage of mastery is that your system will have
become not just a conglomeration of various lists, information, applications,
and tools but rather a cohesive “control room” with all its components
working together to engage ef fectively with whatever circumstance arises.
Y ou will have attained the ability to customize your lists and categories, and
how you use them, in response to changes in your world and your own
increasing sophistication with the possibilities.
This is a reflection of a functional awar eness  of GTD. Y ou understand the
essence and recognize the value of the various parts of the model and
therefore have the freedom to tailor how they are implemented to best serve
your needs.
Y ou could build your own application of the GTD system from scratch, if
need be, with your own tools at hand. Y ou are guided by the principle of
creating and engaging with the necessary orientation “maps” to ensure you
are appropriately focused as required for a given situation.
Y ou’re not at a loss about what to do with anything—a business card you
collected at a lunch meeting, a harebrained idea you woke up with this
morning about a project you might want to launch, an unexpected private
invitation to a major gala event, or your blood panel report from your last
medical checkup.
Y ou can create the right placeholder for any type of potentially meaningful
data.
Y ou can also easily get a sense of your priorities for an upcoming trip; you
have everything you need at hand for the next webinar you’re conducting; it
would take minimal ef fort to pull together a company overview for your
bank; and you can quickly create a rich context for a family conversation
about plans for the next two years. Y ou have a dynamic, working dashboard
that serves your orientation for virtually any context, whether at home, at the
of fice, or in transit, seamlessly .
Pr essur e Pr oduces Gr eater Rather Than Reduced Utilization of These
Practices
One of the most common observations I hear from people who have at some
point bought into the GTD process but have not progressed particularly far
with it is that they fell away from it because they had an intense series of
back-to-back business trips, or an extended bout of the flu, or an unexpected
crisis occur with a major client, or were asked to run a major project in
addition to their regular job, or . . . and so on.
And one of the most common things I hear from people who have  matured
with their application of and experience with the methodology is that
applying Getting Things Done  is the very thing that enabled them to
negotiate these kinds of tense situations with much more ef fectiveness and
much less stress.
So, a significant hallmark of progress in the path of mastery at this stage is
that very transition point when issues and opportunities galvanize GTD
practices instead of causing its users to abandon them. When a new problem
explodes at work, you can get back in control quickly with a new mind
sweep instead of taking everything back up into your head. Y ou identify
desired outcomes, projects, and next actions about this circumstance as soon
as you can, as opposed to simply worrying about what’ s happened. Y ou
actually do a W eekly Review in the middle of the week because you need
that kind of elevated focus to recalibrate your work, instead of reverting
back to latest-and-loudest as your priority criterion.
Operating at this level of GTD mastery is achievable and truly elegant. The
experience, for those who do achieve it, is one of establishing the conditions
to  flourish . What flourish  means and looks like for a twenty-four -year -old
rock musician will likely be very dif ferent than for a fifty-four -year -old
attorney with three kids, but the expanded experience and the process of how
they got there with GTD are identical.
Postgraduate: Focus, Direction, and Creativity
Once you have incorporated the basic elements of Getting Things Done  and
integrated the more elevated aspects of your commitments of life and work
into a trusted and customized systemic approach, the next frontier opens:
using clear internal space to optimize your experience, ad infinitum.
This mastery level involves two key aspects:
Utilizing your freed-up focus for exploring the more elevated aspects of your
commitments and values
Leveraging your external mind to produce novel value
Fr eedom to Engage in the Most Meaningful Things  Once you really
know and trust you can and will execute ef fectively anything that lands in
your in-tray , you will have the freedom to toss anything  into your own in-
tray , whether it’ s your next crazy idea, a possible new technology to
research, a book you might want to write, or an NGO W eb site that almost
brought you to tears that you’d like to support. The power to produce
produces powerful possibilities. *
And, as I hope I’ve made clear throughout this book, the ability to put your
attention on the more subtle and elevated levels of your life and work to a
lar ge degree depends on your being able to “put to bed” the inevitably
necessary more operational and mundane aspects that, without your
appropriate engagement, can easily distract and exhaust your creative focus.
I applaud the people who can suf ficiently compartmentalize their
consciousness to be able to draft a movie script, craft a vision statement for
their NGO, or write the perfect poem for their wedding vows, with all the
stuf f of unanswered e-mails, crashed computer , taxes to be filed, mother -in-
law’ s complaints about the wedding program, and needed bank credit line
extension still impinging on their psyches. I do know that if all of those
issues were quieted with appropriate engagement from a GTD perspective,
the space and inspiration for the more creative activities would be
tremendously enhanced. The negative ef fect on focus and performance of the
cognitive load of these kinds of open loops has now been documented. Many
people attest to their ability to leave work at work and drop everything to
focus on the creative pursuits that interest them, but in my experience that’ s
only because they don’ t have a reference point of what their lives would be
like without that pressure to begin with.
The lack of pervasive angst about the details of your daily life also makes it
much easier to shift your attention to the direction and qualities of
experience that really matter . As I indicated in chapter 2, the upper Horizons
of Focus—
goals, vision, purpose, and principles—are the defining criteria for your
priorities. But most people find the ability to concentrate on and execute
them ef fectively elusive at best and avoided (and guilt producing!) at worst.
A distraction-free mind won’ t by itself get you to think about wild success
scenarios five years in the future—you still have to consciously direct your
attention to those matters—but it does make it infinitely easier to engage in
such an exercise productively .
Leveraging Y our External Mind
Once you are regularly functioning at this level of mastery , the creative
thrust of your “GTD-ing” shifts from implementing the most ef fective way
of dealing with the inputs and inherent demands of your day-to-day world to
optimally taking advantage of self-created contexts and triggers to produce
creative ideas, perspectives, and actions that wouldn’ t normally occur .
W ouldn’ t it be great not to have to think too hard about what you need to
think about?
For instance, if you have ever needed to pur ge and bring up-to-date a contact
manager , as you’ve reviewed old and potentially out-of-date entries of
people and businesses, you’ve invariably come across items that caused you
to tell yourself, “Y ou know , I really ought to get in touch with her again,
given what I’m now doing in my business.” If that kind of catalyzed thought
has ever turned into something in any way valuable, then you’ve tasted at
least a tiny bit of what could be infinitely more utilized. How many more
ideas could any of us have had today that would have potentially added
value to some aspect of our relationships, work, and creative expressions,
had we only brought the right things into our conscious focus with the ability
to capture what might show up?
This highly creative and productive reflection activity automatically occurs
in something like the W eekly Review , when you are glancing at past and
future calendar items (“Oh, that reminds me . . . !”) and updating your
Projects and Next Actions lists (“Ah . . . now I need to . . . !”). Regularly
reassessing your Someday/ Maybe contents of fers an even more expansive
berth (“Y ou know , I think I really am  going to take a painting class!”). But
how many other aspects of your experience and relationships could be
enhanced with the same kind of triggers for reflection? What other contents,
reviewed with some consistency , might reveal valuable ideas? It’ s
challenging enough to build in regular catch-up behaviors, but the
possibilities of going beyond them are endless.
This is the stage of maturity along the GTD path of mastery in which the
simple idea of checklists takes on sublime significance. As cognitive
scientists have validated, your mind is terrible at recalling things out of the
blue, but it is fantastic at doing creative thinking about what it has directly in
front of it to evaluate. When freed from the remembering function, the mind
is a fabulous mechanism to put in play by putting things “in front of the
door” so you don’ t
have to think too hard about what to think about.
How often would you like to be reminded to think about your significant
family members? What, specifically , would be good to remind yourself to
think about when you think about your partner , your son, your sister? Whom
would you consider to be on your A-list in your professional network (the
people whose influence and interactions with you are most valuable)? How
often should you review that list? What af firmations and inspirational
writings would serve you to reconnect with, and at what intervals?
There are obviously an infinite number of opportunities any of us could take
advantage of to add value to our world, with the right kind of structure
established to relieve our psyche of the jobs it does not do well and to
leverage what it does wonderfully . But that will not happen by itself. It is a
hallmark of this advanced level of GTD mastery that you recognize that
dynamic and use your intelligence to leverage itself. It’ s having the freedom
to generate and develop ideas, without constraint, and then utilizing the
practice of processing and or ganizing those notes and thoughts appropriately .
It’ s the smartest individuals who realize they are only randomly in their
“smarts” and inspired.
They’re the ones who intelligently build in systems and processes to take
advantage of the brilliance that often simply lies sleeping behind the dullness
required to deal with the brutish world we inhabit.
This path of GTD mastery—incorporating the fundamentals, utilizing an
elevated and integrated system, and leveraging creative directional focus—is
not actually as limited sequentially as I have laid it out. Most everyone
manifests aspects and portions of all of these levels in his or her own
practices, and I have often met novices in some field who had some
extraordinarily advanced moves.
But in my experience, when the whole gestalt of stress-free productivity is
taken into consideration, it requires a solid progression that does not have
shortcuts.
Y ou can’ t really maintain a sense of week-to-week control if your e-mail is
in chaos. Y ou won’ t really be free to engage with your long-range planning
or vision if you don’ t have a grip on the current reality of the actual
inventory of your seventy-five projects.
Y ou are continually involved in all of these levels, consciously or
unconsciously , explicitly or implicitly . Y ou have appointments, projects,
actions, goals, and values, and as a professional you will find that your work
has its own set of commitments within which you must operate. Y our
mastery of Getting  Things Done  will simply reflect the elegant equanimity
with which you are engaged with all of them. The unexpected e-mail with
the major problem that
just appeared, your aunt Martha’ s birthday this week, the potential change in
strategy for your company , and the new piece of cookware you realize you
want
—each is dealt with quickly , smoothly , and in an appropriate context,
leaving nothing on your mind other than what’ s present in the moment.
