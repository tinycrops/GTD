The Power of the Capturing Habit
Demonstrating integrity in managing internal and external agreements
optimizes all of your relationships.
THERE’S MUCH MORE to these simple techniques and models than may
appear at first glance. Indeed, they of fer a systematic method to keep your
mind distraction-free, ensuring a high level of ef ficiency and ef fectiveness in
your work. That in itself would be suf ficient reason to implement these
practices.
But there are even greater implications for the fundamental principles at
work here. What follows in the next three chapters is an accounting of my
experience, over the past thirty years, of the subtler and often more profound
ef fects that can transpire from the implementation of these basic principles.
The longer -term results can have a significant impact on you as an
individual, and they can positively af fect lar ger or ganizational cultures as
well.
When people with whom you interact notice that without fail you receive,
process, and or ganize in an airtight manner the exchanges and agreements
they have with you, they begin to trust you in a unique way . More
significantly , you incorporate a level of self-confidence in your engagement
with your world that money cannot buy . Such is the power of capturing
placeholders for anything that is incomplete or unprocessed in your life. It
noticeably enhances your mental well-being and improves the quality of
your communications and relationships, both personally and professionally .
And when or ganizations expect and reinforce this best practice of allowing
nothing to fall through a communication crack, with everyone accountable
for resulting actions, and commitments clarified and tracked by the
appropriate persons, it can significantly increase a culture’ s productivity and
reduce its stress.
The Personal Benefit
How did it feel to go through the collecting and downloading activity? Most
people say it feels so bad, and yet so good. How can that be?
If you’re like most people who go through the full capturing process, you
probably felt some form of anxiety . Descriptive terms like overwhelmed ,
panic , frustration , fatigue , and disgust  tend to come up when I ask seminar
participants to describe their emotions in going through a minor version of
this procedure.
And is there anything you think you’ve procrastinated on in that stack? If so,
you have guilt automatically associated with it—“I could have, should have,
ought to have done this before now .”
At the same time, did you experience any sense of release, or relief, or
control as you did the drill? Most people say yes, indeed. How does that
happen?
T otally opposite emotional states showing up as you’re doing a single
exercise, almost at the same time—anxiety and relief; overwhelmed and in
control.
What’ s going on here?
When you understand the source of your negative feelings about all your
stuf f, you’ll discover , as I did, the way to get rid of them. And if you
experienced any positive feelings from collecting your stuf f, you actually
began the process of eliminating the negativity yourself.
The Sour ce of the Negative Feelings
The sense of anxiety and guilt doesn’ t come from having too much to do; it’ s
the automatic result of breaking agreements with yourself.
Where do the not-so-good feelings come from? T oo much to do? No, there’ s
always too much to do. If you felt bad simply because there was more to do
than you could do, you’d never get rid of that feeling. Having too much to
do is not the source of the negative feeling. It comes from a dif ferent place.
How have you felt when someone broke an agreement with you, told you
they would meet you Thursday at four p.m. and never showed or called?
How did that feel? Frustrating, I imagine. The price people pay when they
break an agreement in the world is the disintegration of trust in the
relationship—an automatic negative consequence.
But what are all those things in your in-tray? Agreements you’ve made or at
least implicitly accepted with yourself—things you somehow have told
yourself you should deal with in some way . Y our negative feelings are
simply the result of breaking those agreements—they’re the symptoms of
disintegrated self-trust.
If you tell yourself to draft a strategic plan, when you don’ t do it, you feel
bad.

frustration. Resolve to spend more time with your kids and then don’ t—

How Do Y ou Pr event Br oken Agr eements with Y ourself?
If the negative feelings come from broken agreements, you have three
options for dealing with them and eliminating the negative consequences:
Don’ t make the agreement.
Complete the agreement.
Renegotiate the agreement.
All of these can work to get rid of the unpleasant feelings.
Don’t Make the Agr eement
It probably felt pretty good to take a bunch of your old stuf f, decide that you
weren’ t going to do anything with it, and just shred, recycle, or toss it into
the trash. One way to handle an incompletion in your world is to just say no !
Y ou’d lighten up a lot if you would just lower your standards. If you didn’ t
care so much about things being up to a certain level—your parenting, your
school system, your team’ s morale, the software code—you’d have fewer
things to do or have attention on. *
I doubt you’re going to lower your standards. But once you really
understand the consequences, you’ll probably make fewer agreements. I
know I did. I used to make a lot of them, just to win people’ s approval.
When I realized the price I was paying on the back end for not keeping those
agreements, I became a lot more conscious about the ones I made. One
insurance executive I worked with described the major benefit he derived
from implementation of this system:
“Previously I would just tell everyone, ‘Sure, I’ll do it,’ because I didn’ t
know
how much I really had to do. Now that I’ve got the inventory clear and
complete, just to maintain my integrity , I have had to say , ‘No, I can’ t do
that, I’m sorry .’
The amazing thing is that instead of being upset with my refusal, everyone
was impressed with my discipline!”
Maintaining an objective and complete inventory of your work, regularly
reviewed, makes it much easier to say no with integrity .
Another client, an entrepreneur in the personal coaching business, recently
told me that making an inventory of his work had eliminated a huge amount
of worry and stress from his life. The discipline of putting everything he had
his attention on into his in-tray caused him to reconsider what he really
wanted to do anything  about. If he wasn’ t willing to toss a note about it into
“in,” he just let it go!
I consider that very mature thinking. One of the best things about this whole
method is that when you really take on the responsibility to capture and track
what’ s on your mind, you’ll think twice about making commitments
internally that you don’ t really need or want to make. In my many years of
working with people to get their list of Projects clear and current, every
single person has decided that something was not worth doing that they
thought they were committed to. Not being aware of all you have to do is
much like having a credit card for which you don’ t know the balance or the
limit—it’ s a lot easier to be careless with your commitments.
Complete the Agr eement
Of course, another way to get rid of the negative feelings about your stuf f is
to just finish it and be able to mark it of f as done. Y ou actually love to do
things, as long as you get the feeling that you’ve completed something. If
you’ve begun to take less-than-two-minute actions as they surface in your
life, I’m sure you can attest to the psychological benefit. Most people I work
with feel fantastic after just a couple of hours of processing their piles,
simply because of how many things they accomplish using the two-minute
rule.
Out of the strain of the doing, into the peace of the done.
—Julia Louise W oodruff
One of your better weekends may be spent just finishing up a lot of little
errands and tasks that have accumulated around your house and in your
personal life. Invariably when you capture all the open loops, little and big,
and see them on a list in front of you, some part of you will be inspired (or
creatively disgusted or intimidated enough) to go knock them of f the list.
W e all seem to be starved for a win. It’ s great to satisfy that by giving
yourself doable tasks you can start and finish easily . Have you ever
completed something that wasn’ t initially on a list, so you wrote it down and
checked it of f?
Then you know what I mean.
There’ s another issue here, however . How would you feel if your list and
your stack were totally—and successfully—completed? Y ou’d probably be
bouncing of f the ceiling, full of creative ener gy . Of course, within three days
(if not three minutes!), guess what you’d have? Right—another list, and
probably an even bigger one, with more potentially daunting things to do on
it! Y ou’d feel so good about finishing all your stuf f you’d likely take on
bigger , more ambitious things to do.
Not only that, but if you have a boss (or a board), what do you think he or
she or they are going to do after noticing the high levels of competency and
productivity you’re demonstrating? Right again—give you more things to
do!
It’ s the irony of professional development—the better you get, the better
you’d better  get.
So, since you’re not going to significantly lower your standards or stop
creating more things to do, you’d better get comfortable with the third
option, if you want to keep from being stressed out.
Renegotiate the Agr eement
Suppose I’d told you I would meet you Thursday at four p.m., but after I
made the appointment, my world changed. Now , given my new priorities, I
decide I’m not  going to meet you Thursday at four . But instead of simply not
showing up, what had I better do, to maintain the integrity of the
relationship? Correct—call and change the agreement. A renegotiated
agreement is not a broken one.
It is the act of for giveness that opens up the only possible way to think
cr eatively about the
futur e at all.
—Father Desmond W ilson
Do you understand yet why getting all your stuf f out of your head and in
front of you makes you feel better? Because you automatically renegotiate
your agreements with yourself when you look at them, think about them, and
either act on them that very moment or say , “No, not now .” Here’ s the
problem: it’ s impossible to renegotiate agreements with yourself that you
can’ t remember you made!
The fact that you can’ t remember an agreement you made with yourself
doesn’ t mean that you’re not holding yourself liable for it. Ask any
psychologist how much of a sense of past and future that part of your psyche
has, the part that was storing the list you dumped: zero. It’ s all present tense
in there. That means that as soon as you tell yourself that you should do
something, if you file it only in your short-term memory , that part of you
thinks you should be doing it all the  time . And that means that as soon as
you’ve given yourself two things to do, and filed them only in your head,
you’ve created instant and automatic stress and failure, because you can’ t do
them both at once, and that (apparently significant) part of your psyche will
continue to hold you accountable.
If you’re like most people, you’ve probably got some storage area at home—
maybe a basement that you told yourself a while back (maybe even ten years
ago!) you ought to clean and or ganize. If so, there’ s a part of you that likely
thinks you should’ve been cleaning your basement twenty-four hours a day
for the past ten years! No wonder people are so tired! And have you heard
that little voice inside your own mental committee every time you walk by
that area?
“Why are we walking by the basement? Aren’ t we supposed to be cleaning
it?”
Because you can’ t stand that whining, nagging part of yourself, you never
even go into that area anymore if you can help it. If you want to shut that
voice up, you have three options for dealing with your agreement with
yourself.
I’m quite sincere about this. It seems that there’ s a part of our consciousness
that doesn’ t know the dif ference between an agreement about cleaning the
basement and an agreement about buying a company or improving our
personal finances. In there, they’re all just agreements—kept or broken. If
you’re holding something only internally , it will be a broken agreement if
you’re not moving on it in the moment.
The Radical Departur e fr om T raditional T ime Management  This method
is significantly dif ferent from traditional time-management training. Most of
those models leave you with the impression that if something you tell
yourself to do isn’ t that important, it’ s not worth it to track, manage, or deal
with. But in my experience that’ s inaccurate, at least in terms of how a less-
than-conscious part of us operates. It is  how our conscious mind operates,
however , so every agreement must be made conscious. That means it must
be captured, clarified, and reviewed objectively and regularly in full
conscious awareness so that you can put it where it belongs in your self-
management arena.
If that doesn’ t happen, it will actually take up a lot more of your internal
ener gy than it deserves.
In my experience, anything that is held only in your head will take up either
more or less attention than it deserves. The reason to collect everything is
not that everything is equally important; it’ s that it’ s not . Incompletions,
uncaptured, take on a dull sameness in the sense of the pressure they create
and the attention they tie up.
How Much Capturing Is Requir ed?
Y ou’ll feel better collecting anything  that you haven’ t captured yet. When
you say to yourself, “Oh, that’ s right, I need to get butter the next time I’m at
the store,” and you write it on your grocery list, you’ll feel better . When you
remember , “I’ve got to call my financial adviser about the trust fund,” and
you write that down someplace where you know you’ll see it when you have
a phone and time, you’ll feel better . But there’ s still a light-year ’ s dif ference
when you know you have it all .
When will you know how much you have left in your head to capture? Only
when there’ s nothing left. If some part of you is even vaguely aware that you
don’ t have it all, you can’ t really know what percentage you have collected.
How will you know when there’ s nothing left? When nothing else shows up
as a reminder in your mind.
When the only thing on your mind is the only thing on your mind, you’ll be
“present,” in your
“zone,” with no distinction between work and play .
This doesn’ t mean that your mind will be empty . If you’re conscious, your
mind will always be focusing on something. But if it’ s focusing on only one
thing at a time, without distraction, you’ll be in your “zone.”
I suggest that you use your mind to think about  things, rather than think of
them. Y ou want to be adding value as you think about projects and
situations, not creating stress by simply reminding yourself they exist and
you need to do something about them. T o fully realize that more productive
place, you will need to capture it all. It takes focus and a change of habit to
train yourself to recognize and download even the smallest agreements with
yourself as they’re created in your mind. Doing the capturing process as
fully as you can, and then incorporating the behavior of gathering all the new
things as they emer ge, will be more empowering and productive than you
can imagine.
When Relationships and Or ganizations Have the Capture
Habit
What happens when everyone involved on a team—in a marriage, in a
department, on a staf f, in a family , in a company—can be trusted not to let
anything slip through the cracks? Frankly , once you’ve achieved that, you’ll
hardly think about whether people are dropping the ball anymore—there will
be much bigger and better things to occupy your attention.
Having to bail water in a leaky boat undermines your ability to direct it and
move it forward.
But if communication gaps are still an issue, there’ s likely some layer of
frustration and a general nervousness in the relationship or the culture. Most
people feel that without constant babysitting and hand-holding, things could
disappear in the system and then blow up at any time. They don’ t realize that
they’re feeling this because they’ve been in this situation so consistently that
they relate to it as if it were a permanent law , like gravity . It doesn’ t have to
be that way .
I have noticed this for years. Good people who haven’ t incorporated these
behaviors come into my environment, and they stick out like a sore thumb.
I’ve lived with the standards of a clear head and hard, clean edges on in-
trays for more than three decades now . When a note sits idle in someone’ s
in-tray
unprocessed, or when he or she nods, “Y es, I will,” in a conversation but
doesn’ t otherwise capture that in some way , my “uh-oh” bell rings. This is
unacceptable behavior in my world. There are much bigger fish to fry than
worrying about leaks in the system.
I need to trust that any request or relevant information I put in an e-mail, on
a voice mail, in a conversation, or in a written note will get into the other
person’ s system and that it will be processed and or ganized soon, and
available for his or her review as an option for action. If the recipient is
managing voice mails but not e-mail and paper , I have now been hamstrung
to use only his or her trusted medium. That should be unacceptable behavior
in any or ganization that cares about whether things happen with the least
amount of ef fort.
When change is required, there must be trust that the initiatives for that
change will be dealt with appropriately . Any intact system will ultimately be
only as good as its weakest link, and often that Achilles’ heel is a key
person’ s dulled responsiveness to communications in the system.
I especially notice this when I walk around or ganizations where in-trays are
either nonexistent or overflowing and obviously long unprocessed. These
cultures usually suf fer from serious “interrupt-itis” because they can’ t trust
putting communications into the system. I come across executives whose
calendars are insanely overbooked but who, when they begin to give timely
responses to their e-mails, experience a dramatic relief from that pressure.
When their staf f and others are getting what they need in terms of
appropriate feedback and decisions through that virtual medium, they no
longer need the kind of face-to-face time they previously tried to get with
meetings.
Where cultures do have solid systems, down through the low-tech level of
paper communications, the clarity is palpable. It’ s hardly even a conscious
concern, and everyone’ s attention is more focused. The same is true in
families that have installed in-trays—the parents, the children, the nanny , the
housekeeper , or anyone else with whom family members frequently interact.
People often grimace when I tell them that my wife and I put things in each
other ’ s in-trays, even when we’re sitting within a few feet of each other; to
them it seems cold and mechanical. Aside from being an act of politeness
intended to avoid interrupting the other ’ s work in progress, the practice
actually fosters more warmth and freedom between us, because mechanical
things are being handled in the system instead of tying up our attention on
the relationship.
Or ganizations must create a culture in which it is acceptable that everyone
has more to do than he or she can do, and in which it is sage to renegotiate
agreements about what everyone is not  doing.
Unfortunately , you can’ t legislate personal systems. Everyone must have his
or her own way to deal with what he or she has to deal with. Y ou can,
however , hold people accountable for outcomes, and for tracking and
managing everything that comes their way . And you can give them the
information in this book. Then, at least, they’ll have no excuse for letting
something fall through the cracks.
This doesn’ t mean that everyone has to do everything. I hope I have
described a way to relate to our knowledge-based world that provides room
for everyone to have a lot more to do than he or she can  do. The critical
issue will be to facilitate a constant renegotiation process with all involved,
so they feel OK about what they’re not  doing. That’ s real knowledge work,
at a more sophisticated level. But there’ s little hope of getting there without
having bulletproof capture systems in play . Remember , you can’ t renegotiate
an agreement with yourself that you can’ t remember you made. And you
certainly can’ t renegotiate agreements with others that you and they have
lost track of.
When groups of people collectively adopt the 100 percent capture standard,
they have a tight ship to sail. It doesn’ t mean they’re sailing in the right
direction, or even that they’re on the right ship; it just means that the one
they’re on, in the direction it’ s going, is sailing with the most ef ficient
ener gy it can.
