Capturing: Corralling Y our “Stuf f”
IN CHAPTER 2 I described the basic procedures for capturing your
potential work and meaningful input. This chapter will lead you in more
detail through the process of getting all your incompletes, all your “stuf f,”
into one place—into “in.” That’ s the critical first step in getting to the state
of “mind like water .” Just gathering a few more things than you currently
have will probably create a positive feeling for you. But if you can hang in
there and really do the whole capturing process, 100 percent, it will change
your experience dramatically and give you an important new reference
point for being on top of your work and your world.
When I coach a client through this process, the capture phase usually takes
between one and six hours, though it did take an entire twenty hours with
one person (finally I told him, “Y ou get the idea”). It can take longer than
you think if you are committed to a full-blown collection that will include
everything at work and everywhere else. That means going through every
storage area, including your computers, and every nook and cranny in every
location, including cars, boats, and other garages and homes, if you have
them.
Until you’ve captured everything  that has your attention, some part of you
will still not totally trust that you’re working with the whole picture of your
world.
Be assured that if you give yourself at least a couple of hours to tackle this
part, you can grab the major portion of things outstanding. And you can
even capture the rest by creating relevant placeholding notes—for example,
“Pur ge and process boat storage shed” and “Deal with hall closet.”
In the real world, you probably won’ t be able to keep your stuf f 100 percent
collected all the time. If you’re like most people, you’ll move too fast and
be engaged in too many things during the course of a week to get all your
ideas and
commitments captured outside your head. But it should become an ideal
standard that keeps you motivated to consistently clean house of all the
things about your work and life that have your attention.
Ready , Set . . .
There are very practical reasons to gather everything before you start
clarifying it:
Y ou can only feel good about what you’re not doing when you know
everything you’re not doing.
It can be daunting to capture in one location, at one time, all the things that
don’ t belong where they are. It may even seem a little counterintuitive,
because for the most part, most of that stuf f was not, and is not, “that
important”; that’ s why it’ s still lying around. It wasn’ t an ur gent thing when
it first showed up, and probably nothing’ s blown up yet because it hasn’ t
been dealt with. It’ s the business card you put in your wallet of somebody
you thought you might want to contact sometime. It’ s the little piece of
techno-gear in the bottom desk drawer that you’re missing a part for , or
haven’ t had the time to install properly . It’ s the printer that you keep telling
yourself you’re going to move to a better location in your of fice. These are
the kinds of things that nag at you but that you haven’ t decided either to
deal with or to drop entirely from your list of open loops. But because you
think there still could  be something important in there, that stuf f is
controlling you and taking up more of your ener gy than it deserves.
So it’ s time to begin. Grab your in-tray and half-inch stack of plain paper
for your notes, and let’ s . . .
. . . Go!
Physical Gathering
The first activity is to search your physical environment for anything that
doesn’ t permanently belong where it is, the way it is, and put it into your in-
tray . Y ou’ll
be gathering things that are incomplete, things that have some decision
about potential action tied to them. They all go into “in,” so they’ll be
available for later processing.
What Stays Wher e It Is
The best way to create a clean decision about whether something should go
into the in-tray is to understand clearly what shouldn’ t  go in. Here are the
four categories of things that can remain where they are, the way they are,
with no action tied to them:
Supplies
Reference Material
Decoration
Equipment
Supplies . . . include anything you need to keep because you use it regularly .
Stationery , business cards, stamps, staples, Post-it pads, paper clips,
ballpoint refills, batteries, forms you need to fill out from time to time,
rubber bands—all of these qualify . Many people also have a “personal
supplies” drawer at work containing dental floss, Kleenex, breath mints,
and so on.
Refer ence Material . . . is anything you simply keep for information as
needed, such as manuals for your software, the local takeout deli menu,
your kid’ s sports team schedule, or your list of internal phone extensions.
This category includes all your telephone and address information, any
material relevant to projects, themes, and topics, and sources such as
dictionaries, encyclopedias, almanacs, and bound archives of corporate
records. It also includes books and magazines that you may be keeping as a
library .
Decoration . . . means pictures of family , artwork, and fun and inspiring
things pinned to your bulletin board. Y ou also might have plaques,
mementos, and/or plants.
Equipment . . . is obviously your phone, computer , printer , scanner ,
wastebasket, furniture, clock, char gers, pens, and notepads.
Y ou no doubt have a lot of things that fall into these four categories—
basically all your tools and your gear , which have no actions tied to them.
Everything else goes into “in.” But many of the things you might initially
interpret as supplies, reference, decoration, or equipment could also have
action associated with them because they still aren’ t exactly the way they
need to be.
For instance, most people have, in their desk drawers, on their shelves and
bulletin boards, and tucked away in computer files a lot of materials and
information that either are out of date or need to be or ganized somewhere
else.
Those should go into “in.” Likewise, if your supplies drawer is out of
control, full of lots of dead or unor ganized stuf f, that’ s an incomplete that
needs to be captured. Are the photos of your kids current ones? Is the
artwork what you want on the wall? Are the mementos really something
you still want to keep? Is the furniture precisely the way it should be? Is the
computer set up the way you want it? Are the plants in your of fice alive? In
other words, supplies, reference materials, decoration, and equipment may
need to be tossed into the in-tray if they’re not just where they should be,
the way they should be.
Issues About Capturing
As you engage in the capturing step, you may run into one or more of the
following:
you’ve got a lot more than will fit into one in-tray;
you’re likely to get derailed into pur ging and or ganizing;
you may have some form of stuf f already collected and or ganized; and/or
you’re likely to run across some critical things that you want to keep in
front of you.
What If an Item Is T oo Big to Go in the In-T ray? If you can’ t physically put
something in the in-tray , then write a note on a piece of letter -size plain
paper to represent it. For instance, if you have a poster or other piece of
artwork behind the door to your of fice, just write “Artwork behind door” on
a letter -size piece of paper and put the paper in the in-tray .
Be sure to date it, too. This has a couple of benefits. If your or ganization
system winds up containing some of these pieces of paper representing
something else, it’ll be useful to know when the note was created. It’ s also
just a great habit to date everything you handwrite, from Post-it notes for
your
assistant, to voice mails you transfer onto a pad, to the note you take on a
phone call with a client. If you are using a digital tool that has a date-stamp
function, it’ s great to use that for the same reason. The 3 percent of the time
that this little piece of information will be extremely useful makes it worth
developing the simple habit.
What If the Pile Is T oo Big to Fit into the In-T ray? If you’re like 98 percent
of the people we work with individually , your initial gathering activity will
collect much more than can be comfortably stacked in an in-tray . If that’ s
the case, just create stacks around the in-tray , and maybe even on the floor
below it.
Ultimately you’ll be eliminating the stacks, as you process and or ganize
everything. In the meantime, though, make sure that there’ s some obvious
visual distinction between the stacks that are “in” and everything else.
Instant Dumping If it’ s immediately evident that something is trash, go
ahead and toss it when you see it. For some of my clients, this marks the
first time they have ever cleaned their center desk drawer!
If you’re not sure what something is or whether it’ s worth keeping, go
ahead and put it into “in.” Y ou’ll be able to decide about it later , when you
process the in-tray . What you don’ t  want to do is to let yourself get wrapped
up in things piece-by-piece, trying to decide this or that. Clarifying requires
a very dif ferent mind-set than capturing; it’ s best to do them separately .
Y ou’ll process your stuf f later anyway if it’ s in “in,” and it’ s easier to make
those kinds of choices when you’re in that decision-making mode. The
objective for the capturing process is to get everything into “in” as quickly
as possible  so you’re appropriately retrenched and have “drawn the battle
lines.”
No person who can r ead is ever successful at cleaning out an attic.
—Ann Landers
Be Car eful of the Pur ge-and-Or ganize Bug! Many people get hit with the
pur ge-and-or ganize virus as they’re going through various areas of their
of fice (and their home). If that happens to you, it’ s OK, so long as you have
a major open window of time to get through the whole process (at least a
whole week).
Otherwise you’ll need to break it up into chunks and capture them as little
projects or actions to do, with reminders in your system, like “Pur ge four -
drawer cabinet” or “Clean of fice closet.”
What you don’ t  want to do is let yourself get caught running down a rabbit
trail cleaning up some piece of your work and then not be able to get
through the whole action-management implementation process. It may take
longer than you think, and you want to go for the gold and finish processing
all your stuf f and setting up your system as soon as possible.
What About Things That Ar e Alr eady on Lists and in Or ganizers? Y ou may
already have some lists and some sort of or ganization system in place. But
unless you’re thoroughly familiar with this workflow-processing model and
have implemented it previously , I recommend that you treat those lists as
items still to be processed, like everything else in “in.” Y ou’ll want your
system to be consistent, and it’ll be necessary to evaluate everything from
the same viewpoint to get it that way .*
“But I Can’ t Lose That Thing . . . !” Often in the capturing process someone
will run across a piece of paper or a document that causes her to say , “Oh,
my God! I for got about that! I’ve got to deal with that!” It could be a note
about a call she was supposed to handle two days before, or some meeting
notes that remind her of an action she was supposed to take weeks ago. She
doesn’ t want to put whatever it is in the huge stack of other stuf f in her in-
tray because she’ s afraid she might lose track of it again.
If that happens to you, first ask yourself if it’ s something that really has  to
be handled before you get through this initial implementation time. If so,
best deal with it immediately so you get it of f your mind. If not, go ahead
and put it into
“in.” Y ou’re going to get all that processed and emptied soon anyway , so it
won’ t be lost.
If you can’ t deal with the action in the moment, and you still just have  to
have the reminder right in front of you, go ahead and create an “emer gency”
stack somewhere close at hand. It’ s not an ideal solution, but it’ll do. Keep
in mind that some potential anxiousness is going to surface as you make
your stuf f more conscious to you than it’ s been. Create whatever supports
you need.
Start with Y our Desktop
Ready now? OK. Start piling those things on your desk into “in.” Often
there’ll
be numerous things right at hand that need to go in there. Many people use
their whole desktop as “in”; if you’re one of them, you’ll have several
stacks around you to begin your collection with. Start at one end of your
workspace and move around, dealing with everything you come across.
T ypical items will be: Stacks of mail, memos, reports, reading materials
Post-it notes
Collected business cards
Receipts
Meeting notes
It’ s easy to resist and avoid picking up anything in your world that you
know requires some thinking.
Resist the ur ge to say , as almost everyone does initially , “W ell, I know
what’ s in that stack, and that’ s where I want to leave it.” That’ s exactly what
hasn’ t worked before, and it all needs to go into the in-tray . I have never
had anyone who gave in and actually put their familiar stacks through this
system who didn’ t feel a ton of relief when they did.
As you go around your desktop, ask yourself if you have any intention of
changing any of the tools or equipment there. Are your mobile devices and
phone system OK? Y our computer? The desk itself? If anything needs
changing, write a note about it and toss it into “in.”
Desk Drawers
Next tackle the desk drawers, if you have them, one at a time. Any attention
on anything in there? Any actionable items? Is there anything that doesn’ t
belong there? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, put the
actionable item into
“in” or write a note about it. Again, whether you use this opportunity to
clean and or ganize the drawers or simply make a note to do it later will
depend on how much time you have and how much stuf f is in there.
Countertops
Continue working your way around your of fice, collecting everything
sitting on
the tops of cabinets or tables or counters that doesn’ t belong there
permanently .
Often there will be stacks of reading material, mail, reports, and
miscellaneous folders and support material for action and projects. Collect
it all.
Maybe there is reference material that you’ve already used and just left out.
If that’ s so, and if you can return it to the file cabinet or the bookshelf in
just a second, go ahead and do that. Be careful to check with yourself,
though, about whether there is some potential action tied to the material
before you put it away .
If there is, put it into “in” so you can deal with it later in the process.
Inside the Cabinets
Consider whether your collectible and nostalgia items are still meaningful
to you.
Now look inside the cabinets. What’ s in there? These are perfect areas for
stashing lar ge supplies and reference materials, and equally seductive for
holding deeper levels of stuf f. Any broken or out-of-date things in there?
Often I’ll find collectibles and nostalgia that aren’ t meaningful to the person
any longer . One general manager of an insurance of fice, for example,
wound up tossing out at least three dozen recognition awards he had
accumulated over the years.
Again, if some of these areas are out of control and need pur ging and
or ganizing, write that on a note and toss it into “in.”
Floors, W alls, and Shelves
Anything on bulletin boards that needs action? Anything tacked onto the
walls that doesn’ t belong there? Any attention on your pictures, artwork,
plaques, or decorations? How about the open shelves? Any books that need
to be read or donated? Any catalogs, manuals, or binders that are out of date
or have some potential action associated with them? Any piles or stacks of
things on the floor?
Just scoot them over next to your in-tray to add to the inventory .
Equipment, Furnitur e, and Fixtur es
Is there anything you want to do to or change about any of your of fice
equipment or furniture or the physical space itself? Does everything work?
Do you have all the lighting you need? If there are actionable items, you
know what to do: make a note and put it in “in.”
Other Locations
Don’ t let things to be handled that you have considered “not so important”
gnaw away at your ener gy and focus.
Depending on the scope of what you’re addressing in this process, you may
want to do some version of the same kind of gathering anywhere else you
keep stuf f.
As I mentioned in the previous chapter , if you’re determined to get to a
really empty head, it’ s imperative you do it everywhere.
Some people I work with find it immensely valuable to take me home with
them, or to a second of fice location, and have me walk them through this
process there as well. Often they’ve allowed the “not so important” trap to
ensnare them in their home life and secondary workspaces, and it has
gnawed away at their ener gy .
This Is Not About Thr owing Things A way That Y ou Might W ant
People often mistake my advice as an advocacy for radical minimalism. On
the contrary , if throwing something away is uncomfortable for you, you
should  keep it .*  Otherwise you would have attention on the fact that you
now don’ t have something you might want or need. My counsel is how to
assess and or ganize whatever you keep in your ecosystem so that it doesn’ t
pull on your focus unnecessarily . In many areas I’m a confirmed pack rat
(such as with digital photos). The issues are simply how much room you
have, and that you have made the appropriate distinctions that don’ t leave
embedded projects and actions submer ged in what you’re keeping. Y ou like
having and keeping your twelve boxes of old journals and notes from
college? Y ou like keeping all kinds of nutty toys and artwork and gadgets
around your of fice to spur creative thinking? No problem, as long as they
are where you want them to be, in the form they’re in, and you have
anything you want or need to do about that captured and processed in your
system.
Mental Gathering: The Mind Sweep
Once you feel you’ve collected all the physical things in your environment
that need processing, you’ll want to collect anything else that may be
residing in your mental RAM space. What has your attention that isn’ t
represented by something already in your in-tray?
This is where the stack of plain paper really comes into play . I recommend
that you write out each thought, each idea, each project or thing that has
your attention, on a separate sheet of paper . Y ou could make one long list
on a pad, or in some digital application, but given how you will later be
processing each item individually , it’ s actually more ef fective on separate
sheets. There is a discipline required initially to stay focused on one item at
a time, as you process it. So giving each thought its own placeholder , as
trivial as it might seem, makes it that much easier . And your first captured
thought will seldom be the final content you’ll want to track about it (the
desired outcome and next action for it will be). Y ou will likely not keep
these pieces of paper , but it’ll be handy to have them as discrete items to
deal with as you’re processing. *
It will probably take you between twenty minutes and an hour to clear your
head onto separate notes, after you’ve gathered everything else. Y ou’ll find
that things will tend to occur to you in somewhat random fashion—little
things, big things, personal things, professional things, in no particular
order .
In this instance, go for quantity . It’ s much better to overdo this process than
to risk missing something. Y ou can always toss the junk later . Y our first
idea may be “Implement global climate change,” and then you’ll think, “I
need cat food!” Grab them all. Don’ t be surprised if you discover you’ve
created quite a stack of paper in “in” during this procedure.
T riggers List
T o assist in clearing your head, you may want to review the following
Incompletion T riggers list, item by item, to see if you’ve for gotten
anything.
Often you’ll just need a jog to unearth something lurking in the back of
your mind. Remember , when something occurs to you, write it on a piece of
paper and toss it into “in.”

The “In” Inventory
Capturing is complete when you can easily see the outer edges to the
inventory of everything that still has some of your attention in any way .
If your head is empty of everything, personally and professionally , then
your in-tray is probably quite full and likely spilling over . In addition to the
paper -based and physical items in your in-tray , your inventory of “in”
should include any
resident voice mails and all the e-mails that are currently staged in the “in”
area of your communication software. It should also include any items on
your or ganizer lists for which you have not yet determined next actions.
I usually recommend that people transfer their voice mails onto paper notes
and put those into their in-trays, along with any or ganizer notebooks they
may have used, the contents of which often need significant reassessment.
If you’ve been using a digital application for anything other than calendar
and contact information, I suggest you print out any task and to-do lists and
put them, too, into your in-tray . E-mails are best left where they are,
because of their volume and the ef ficiency factor of dealing with them
within their own subsystem.
But “In” Doesn’t Stay in “In”
When you’ve done all that, you’re ready to take the next step. Y ou don’ t
want to leave anything in “in” for an indefinite period of time, because then
it would without fail creep back into your consciousness, since your mind
would know you weren’ t dealing with it. Of course, one of the main factors
in people’ s resistance to collecting stuf f into “in” is the lack of a good
processing and or ganizing methodology to handle it.
That brings us to the next chapter: “Getting ‘In’ to Empty .”
